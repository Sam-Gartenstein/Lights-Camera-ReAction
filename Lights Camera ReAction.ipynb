**outlining** the pilot episode scene-by-scene.  \n","**Scene 1** is generated directly from the outline to establish the world and tone.  \n","After that, each new scene is **scripted, reviewed, and

using ReAct agents**:\n","\n","- **More structured and transparent thinking:** Agents reason step-by-step before making edits.\n","- **Dynamic adaptation:** Agents flexibly plan the next creative

worldbuilding.\n","\n","---\n","\n","After generation, each scene is **summarized and stored in a vector database**, enabling fast retrieval of scene metadata for future story planning.  \n","By

[Suggestion] — As Robbie is helping the elderly woman, have him use unconventional and comedic items to try to unlock the door.

(Justification: This can build on a running joke from previous scenes where Robbie is always seen to be resourceful, using odd items to fix problems around the office or at home).\n","2. [Suggestion] — Introduce a funny dialogue exchange where the elderly woman continually forgets Robbie's name throughout the conversation, calling him by other names like Ricky, Richard, or even Roberta. Robbie gently corrects her each time with a smile, showing his patience and charm. This can serve as a humorous running gag for the character of the elderly woman, who might be a recurring client of Robbie's.

Short Explanation Why: Robbie's reaction to the unexpected news would likely be a mix of absent-mindedness and resourcefulness, consistent with his established personality traits. His patient speaking style would also be appropriate in this situation. The news about his uncle's death and the inheritance could potentially introduce a new emotional arc for Robbie, but it doesn't contradict his established character profile.\n","\n","Interaction Improvement Recommendations:\n","1. Robbie could react to the news of his uncle's death by absentmindedly misplacing the inheritance letter and having to scramble to find it. This interaction would play off his established trait of forgetfulness from Scenes 1 and 2. It would add a comedic layer to an otherwise serious moment and be consistent with Robbie's character, who uses humor to cope with stressful situations (Scene 1).\n","2. Robbie could have a heartfelt conversation with Mrs. Perkins about his uncle's passing and the inherited locksmith shop. Despite Mrs. Perkins repeatedly calling him by the wrong name, Robbie maintains his patience and shares his feelings. This interaction would highlight Robbie's patient and friendly relationship with Mrs. Perkins established in Scene 2, and it would help to contrast the humorous elements of the scene with a genuine moment of vulnerability.\n","\n","Agent's Internal Thoughts:\n","- Think: Identified characters ['Robbie'] using context from scene(s) [1, 2].\n","- Act: Retrieved profiles for ['Robbie'].\n","- Observe: Scene is consistent.\n","- Recommend: Provided suggestions for enhancing character dynamics.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Comedy Agent"],"metadata":{"id":"SoZ5YFR9q-vT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Initialize the comedy agent with the language model client, metadata store, and scene history window\n","comedic_agent = ComedicAgent(\n","    client=client,\n","    vector_metadata=vector_metadata,\n","    num_scenes=2\n",")\n","\n","# Evaluate Scene 3 using the comedy agent and store the evaluation results\n","com_context, com_is_consistent, com_analysis_text, com_recommendations, com_thoughts = evaluate_comedic_agent_scene(\n","    agent=comedic_agent,\n","    scene_description=scene_3_desc,\n","    scene_number=3\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"d1rkV9qqz2r6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747007070185,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":13865,"user":{"displayName":"Samuel Gartenstein","userId":"07750795269941223951"}},"outputId":"c1d4fd77-6b80-4488-a74a-54b290ea92f0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["🔁 Agent will consider the last 2 scene(s) for context.\n","\n","📚 Retrieving script metadata for scene(s): [1, 2]\n","Scene 3 — Comedic Tone: ❌ Inconsistent\n","\n","Comedic Tone Analysis:\n","3. Short Explanation: The previous scenes were light-hearted and slapstick, focusing on Robbie's clumsiness and poor eyesight. The new scene introduces a darker tone with the news of Robbie's uncle's death, which is a significant shift from the previous comedic tone.\n","\n","Comedic Improvement Recommendations:\n","1. [Suggestion] - Robbie is handed a very poorly written obituary for his uncle that has glaring errors and comically misrepresents his uncle's life. This could include absurd references like his uncle being an astronaut, a professional wrestler or a sea captain, when in reality he was a humble locksmith. Robbie, with his poor eyesight, initially believes these exaggerations before realizing the silliness of it all. — (This builds on Robbie's established character trait of poor eyesight from previous scenes and introduces the news of his uncle's death in a humorous way, maintaining the light-hearted tone of the show.)\n","2. [Suggestion] - When Robbie visits the locksmith shop that he's inherited, he accidentally knocks over a massive wall of keys. He spends the rest of the scene comically struggling to put them back, constantly dropping them and picking up the wrong ones. He could also be overwhelmed by customers who come in asking for very specific keys, to which Robbie, having no knowledge of locksmithing, responds with hilarious non-sequiturs. — (This draws on Robbie's established clumsiness, adds physical comedy, and creates a humorous situation around his new inheritance, keeping with the slapstick humor of previous scenes.)\n","\n","Comedic Agent's Internal Thoughts:\n","- Think: Will retrieve summaries and jokes from scene(s) [1, 2] for Scene 3.\n","- Act: Retrieved summaries and jokes from prior scenes.\n","- Observe: Scene is inconsistent with prior comedic tone.\n","- Recommend: Provided comedic improvements.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Enviroment Agent\n"],"metadata":{"id":"s1o8wr8jtsuE"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Initialize the environment agent with the language model client, metadata store, and scene history window\n","environment_agent = EnvironmentAgent(\n","    client=client,\n","    vector_metadata=vector_metadata,\n","    num_scenes=2\n",")\n","\n","# Evaluate Scene 3 using the environment agent and store the evaluation results\n","context, is_consistent, explanation, env_recommendations, env_thoughts = evaluate_environment_agent_scene(\n","    agent=environment_agent,\n","    scene_description=scene_3_desc,\n","    scene_number=3\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"vuQawzfLz2pY","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747007078685,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":8506,"user":{"displayName":"Samuel Gartenstein","userId":"07750795269941223951"}},"outputId":"3ddcc9f4-e06d-445d-d9ba-ea35b8acba34"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["🔁 Environment Agent will consider the last 2 scene(s) for context.\n","\n","📚 Retrieving script metadata for scene(s): [1, 2]\n","Scene 3 — Environment Transition: ✅ Consistent\n","\n","Explanation:\n","Short Explanation: The transition from Robbie's apartment above the locksmith shop to Robbie's Locksmith Workshop, and then to the Locksmith Shop itself is logical.

[Suggestion] - As Jerry walks into the shop, have him subtly humming or quietly singing a recognizable tune from a famous Broadway musical.

This sudden character shift adds humor through contrast. — (This builds on Jerry's character — tough on the outside, Broadway enthusiast on the inside. It adds a layer of humor by incorporating Jerry's unexpected and enthusiastic response.)\n","2. [Suggestion] - Robbie, trying to appease Jerry, tells him he's thinking of starting a musical workshop for ex-cons. Jerry, excited, starts suggesting Broadway numbers they could perform. He gets carried away, even demonstrating a dance move or two, before catching himself and sternly reminding Robbie to stay out of trouble. This balance of Jerry's Broadway passion and professional responsibilities keeps the humor grounded and character-consistent. — (This suggestion integrates a light running joke that Robbie always comes up with unlikely business ideas.

Short Explanation Why: Robbie's sincerity and humor are consistent with his previous scenes, as he could be expected to have a serious conversation with Melissa while still maintaining his humorous side. Melissa's persistence and caring nature are also consistent, as she would likely want to help Robbie and be involved in the business. Their dialogue and actions are logical based on their established traits and relationships. There are no contradictions based on past scenes.\n","\n","Interaction Improvement Recommendations:\n","1. Robbie clumsily spills a cup of coffee on Melissa's photo album during their heart-to-heart talk — (This interaction is consistent with Robbie's clumsiness shown in Scene 2 where he knocks over keys and misplaces Uncle Pete's inheritance letter. It would also create a humorous situation which is characteristic of Robbie's scenes.)\n","2. Melissa, instead of getting annoyed, reacts with understanding and uses this moment to share a funny story about her mother and a similar incident from her childhood — (This fits Melissa's caring and persistent nature as demonstrated when she saves a family heirloom in her previous scenes. It also aligns with her direct and inquisitive speaking style as she uses this opportunity to further delve into their past.)\n","\n","Agent's Internal Thoughts:\n","- Think: Identified characters ['Robbie', 'Melissa'] using context from scene(s) [3, 4, 5].\n","- Act: Retrieved profiles for ['Robbie', 'Melissa'].\n","- Observe: Scene is consistent.\n","- Recommend: Provided suggestions for enhancing character dynamics.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 🎤 Comedic Agent\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pohIfqPHvKzP"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Initialize the comedy agent with the language model client, metadata store, and scene history window\n","comedic_agent = ComedicAgent(\n","    client=client,\n","    vector_metadata=vector_metadata,\n","    num_scenes=3\n","\n","# Evaluate Scene 6 using the comedy agent and store the evaluation results\n","com_context, com_is_consistent, com_analysis_text, com_recommendations, com_thoughts = evaluate_comedic_agent_scene(\n","    agent=comedic_agent,\n","    scene_description=scene_6_desc,\n","    scene_number=6\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"Q6JMY-Vlu30X","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747007317281,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":12812,"user":{"displayName":"Samuel Gartenstein","userId":"07750795269941223951"}},"outputId":"7b26b967-af16-4cc6-ef2d-4b35f3a393d9"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["🔁 Agent will consider the last 3 scene(s) for context.\n","\n","📚 Retrieving script metadata for scene(s): [3, 4, 5]\n","Scene 6 — Comedic Tone: ✅ Consistent\n","\n","Comedic Tone Analysis:\n","3.

[Suggestion] — As Robbie and Melissa have this heart-to-heart, let's use their surroundings to add some humor. They could be in their new office, which is still a mess from moving in. Robbie, trying to have a serious conversation, keeps getting interrupted by mundane issues. For instance, he dramatically confesses his fear of running the business alone, only for his chair to squeak loudly every time he moves. Melissa tries to suppress her laughter, saying, \"Robbie, I'm trying to take you seriously, but your chair sounds like a distressed mouse.\" This would provide a light-hearted tone, showing that even in serious moments, they can find humor and not take themselves too seriously.\n","2. [Suggestion] — Melissa could be eating an orange (a callback from a previous episode where Robbie revealed his irrational fear of citrus fruits) while they talk. Melissa could casually offer Robbie a piece, forgetting about his fear. He recoils dramatically, causing Melissa to break into laughter and say, \"I forgot about your citrophobia!

Short Explanation: The tone of the new scene is consistent with the previous scenes. It maintains a balance of humor and surprise, which is a recurring theme in the previous scenes. The characters continue to use humor to navigate their interactions, and unexpected elements (like Melissa's sleight of hand skills) add to the comedic surprise.\n","\n","Comedic Improvement Recommendations:\n","1. Suggestion: As Robbie explains the locksmithing process, Melissa becomes overly enthusiastic, interrupting Robbie with outlandish hypothetical situations. For instance, she might say something like, \"So, if I was trapped in an ancient tomb with only a hairpin and my wits, I could use these skills to escape, right?\" Robbie responds, flustered, \"Well, yeah, I suppose... but it's usually more about helping people who've locked themselves out of their apartment, not Indiana Jones stuff.\" — This adds humor by playing off the contrast between Melissa's adventurous imagination and Robbie's more mundane, practical perspective, a dynamic established in previous scenes.\n","2. Suggestion: Melissa reveals her sleight of hand skills by 'magically' producing the right locksmithing tools out of thin air just as Robbie needs them, leaving him baffled each time. After Robbie expresses his amazement, Melissa coyly responds, \"Well, you said always be prepared,\" referencing Robbie's earlier advice about being a locksmith. — This not only showcases Melissa's unexpected skills but also pokes fun at Robbie's earlier serious advice, creating a humorous callback to a previous scene.\n","\n","Comedic Agent's Internal Thoughts:\n","- Think: Will retrieve summaries and jokes from scene(s) [4, 5, 6] for Scene 7.\n","- Act: Retrieved summaries and jokes from prior scenes.\n","- Observe: Scene is consistent with prior comedic tone.\n","- Recommend: Provided comedic improvements.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 🌆 Environment Agent\n"],"metadata":{"id":"zHQhc7qoyA7p"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Initialize the environment agent with the language model client, metadata store, and scene history window\n","environment_agent = EnvironmentAgent(\n","    client=client,\n","    vector_metadata=vector_metadata,\n","    num_scenes=3\n",")\n","\n","# Evaluate Scene 7 using the environment agent and store the evaluation results\n","context, is_consistent, explanation, env_recommendations, env_thoughts = evaluate_environment_agent_scene(\n","    agent=environment_agent,\n","    scene_description=scene_7_desc,\n","    scene_number=7\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"nFHXlBvcv-dd","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747007418960,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":9840,"user":{"displayName":"Samuel Gartenstein","userId":"07750795269941223951"}},"outputId":"0940a74d-146a-47ed-b876-87d011533d5d"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["🔁 Environment Agent will consider the last 3 scene(s) for context.\n","\n","📚 Retrieving script metadata for scene(s): [4, 5, 6]\n","Scene 7 — Environment Transition: ✅ Consistent\n","\n","Explanation:\n","Short Explanation: The transition from the office back to the locksmith shop is logical.

His potential clumsiness in the loft could also lead to humorous situations, consistent with his established personality.\n","\n","Interaction Improvement Recommendations:\n","1. Melissa should reveal the secret loft to Robbie with a humorous anecdote about how she discovered it, possibly involving Mr. Nibbles the hamster. — Just as she did in Scenes 1 and 3, Melissa can use her unique past experiences to lighten the situation and create a running joke about her life's oddities.\n","2. Robbie, in his usual clumsy fashion, should accidentally trigger a hidden mechanism in the loft, leading to the revealing of another secret space or item. — This would continue the running theme of Robbie inadvertently causing chaos (Scene 1 and 2) and also tie in with Melissa's recurring theme of unintentionally opening locks or safes (Scene 2 and 3).

Short Explanation Why: The planned scene \"Evening at the Shop\" aligns with the established character profiles of Robbie and Melissa. Robbie's engaging conversational style and humorous personality are consistent with bonding over shared stories and laughs. Similarly, Melissa's witty speaking style and her enjoyment of sharing stories about her life also align with the planned scene. Their close relationship, as established in previous scenes, supports the idea of them spending an evening together at the shop.\n","\n","Interaction Improvement Recommendations:\n","1. Robbie challenges Melissa to a friendly lock-picking competition using a particularly complex lock he's been working on. — Robbie's playful and competitive nature was first shown in Scene 1 when he challenged Melissa to unlock the door. This interaction builds on that while also allowing Robbie to show his curiosity about lock designs and Melissa to showcase her resourcefulness.\n","2. Melissa reveals she's found another secret compartment in the shop, this time hidden within an old clock. She excitedly shows Robbie, hinting at another adventure. — This interaction plays on Melissa's knack for unintentionally discovering secrets as seen in Scenes 1 and 3. It also gives a nod to Robbie's adventurous spirit, shown in Scene 3, and keeps up the running joke of Melissa always stumbling upon hidden things.\n","\n","Agent's Internal Thoughts:\n","- Think: Identified characters ['Robbie', 'Melissa'] using context from scene(s) [7, 8, 9].\n","- Act: Retrieved profiles for ['Robbie', 'Melissa'].\n","- Observe: Scene is consistent.\n","- Recommend: Provided suggestions for enhancing character dynamics.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 🎤 Comedic Agent\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MM_3NYel1Wl-"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Initialize the comedy agent with the language model client, metadata store, and scene history window\n","comedic_agent = ComedicAgent(\n","    client=client,\n","    vector_metadata=vector_metadata,\n","    num_scenes=3\n",")\n","\n","# Evaluate Scene 10 using the comedy agent and store the evaluation results\n","com_context, com_is_consistent, com_analysis_text, com_recommendations, com_thoughts = evaluate_comedic_agent_scene(\n","    agent=comedic_agent,\n","    scene_description=scene_10_desc,\n","    scene_number=10\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"MFR1WMjv0jrE","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747007674241,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":11649,"user":{"displayName":"Samuel Gartenstein","userId":"07750795269941223951"}},"outputId":"6dc3aa9c-a863-4cf2-9c15-ee05d4defb95"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["🔁 Agent will consider the last 3 scene(s) for context.\n","\n","📚 Retrieving script metadata for scene(s): [7, 8, 9]\n","Scene 10 — Comedic Tone: ✅ Consistent\n","\n","Comedic Tone Analysis:\n","3.

Suggestion: While sharing stories, have Robbie tell a story about a ridiculous customer request, only for Melissa to realize that she was that customer. She tries to play it off like it was a joke, but Robbie isn't convinced. This could lead to a light, humorous conflict and give Melissa an opportunity to show her quick wit. — (This could build on a running joke about Robbie's encounters with eccentric customers and add a surprising twist by making Melissa one of them. It also reinforces the dynamic between Robbie and Melissa, where Robbie is often the straight man to Melissa's more comedic character.)\n","2. Suggestion: Later, they find an old karaoke machine in the back of the shop. Melissa dares Robbie to sing his favorite song. He's reluctant at first, but then belts out a surprisingly heartfelt rendition of a cheesy 80s ballad, to Melissa's delight. — (This suggests Robbie has a hidden soft side and also introduces a recurring light joke about his secret love for 80s music, providing a fun, character-revealing moment. It also adds a playful dynamic to Robbie and Melissa's relationship.)\n","\n","Comedic Agent's Internal Thoughts:\n","- Think: Will retrieve summaries and jokes from scene(s) [7, 8, 9] for Scene 10.\n","- Act: Retrieved summaries and jokes from prior scenes.\n","- Observe: Scene is consistent with prior comedic tone.\n","- Recommend: Provided comedic improvements.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 🌆 Environment Agent\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Qc9IUmh51XNC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Initialize the environment agent with the language model client, metadata store, and scene history window\n","environment_agent = EnvironmentAgent(\n","    client=client,\n","    vector_metadata=vector_metadata,\n","    num_scenes=3\n",")\n","\n","# Evaluate Scene 10 using the environment agent and store the evaluation results\n","context, is_consistent, explanation, env_recommendations, env_thoughts = evaluate_environment_agent_scene(\n","    agent=environment_agent,\n","    scene_description=scene_10_desc,\n","    scene_number=10\n",")"],"metadata":{"id":"01-wKmW50jmf","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747007682792,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":8548,"user":{"displayName":"Samuel Gartenstein","userId":"07750795269941223951"}},"outputId":"0ac72b2b-748b-4f46-bd99-6f5f5a6958ba"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["🔁 Environment Agent will consider the last 3 scene(s) for context.\n","\n","📚 Retrieving script metadata for scene(s): [7, 8, 9]\n","Scene 10 — Environment Transition: ✅ Consistent\n","\n","Explanation:\n","Short Explanation: The transition from a Secret Loft to a Shop is logical and believable.

My Uncle Pete passed away. \n","\n","Robbie's sincerity is interrupted by a CUSTOMER who walks in with an absurd request.\n","\n","CUSTOMER:\n","Do you have a key that opens every door in the city?\n","\n","[Laugh Track]\n","\n","ROBBIE:\n","I'm afraid not, sir. Let me just find this... \n","\n","Robbie looks for the inheritance letter, knocking over a can of 'Bacon & Eggs' air freshener, spraying the customer.\n","\n","[Laugh Track]\n","\n","CUSTOMER:\n","What in the...\n","\n","ROBBIE:\n","Sorry, sir!

LOCKSMITH SHOP - DAY]\n","\n","The BROADWAY RADIO is playing, slightly out of tune, in the background as JERRY, the stern parole officer, enters the shop.\n","\n","JERRY: (in a stern voice) Robbie, we need to talk about your Uncle Pete's situation.\n","\n","ROBBIE: (nods) Yeah, Jerry, I know.

We should start a musical workshop for ex-cons!\n","\n","Jerry's eyes light up, revealing his hidden passion for Broadway musicals.\n","\n","JERRY: (enthused) That's... That's not a bad idea, Robbie! We could start with some numbers from Les Misérables or Cats...\n","\n","Just as Jerry starts to get carried away, the shop's door chime rings, interrupting their conversation. A CUSTOMER enters the shop.\n","\n","[Laugh Track]\n","\n","Jerry immediately snaps back to his professional self.\n","\n","JERRY: (sternly) We'll continue this later, Robbie...\n","\n","Robbie nods, smiling to himself as he goes to assist the customer.
