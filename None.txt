INT. FRED'S SMALL-TOWN VET CLINIC – MORNING

FRED, a middle-aged, disheveled and clearly bored vet, is examining a large, noisy PIG. Farmer JIM, a burly, boisterous man in his 60s, watches anxiously.

FRED
(to the pig)
Well, Mrs. Oinks-a-lot, you appear to be in excellent health.

[LAUGH TRACK]

JIM
You sure, Fred? She seems off. Eating less slop, avoiding the mud...

FRED
(sighs)
Jim, for the last time, pigs can't have existential crises.

[LAUGH TRACK]

JIM
But she's been so melancholic lately, Fred. I'm worried.

FRED
Jim, you're anthropomorphizing. She's a pig. She doesn't have feelings in the same way we do.

Fred completes the check-up and begins to clean up his tools.

JIM
(confused)
Anthro-what now?

[LAUGH TRACK]

FRED
(assigning)
It means you're attributing human traits to animals. Now, if there's nothing else, I've got a schedule to keep.

Jim looks at Fred and then at the pig.

JIM
(sincerely)
I just want her to be happy, Fred.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Fred stops and looks at Jim, then at the pig, then back at Jim.

FRED
(defeated)
Alright, Jim. I'll prescribe some happy pig pills.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Fred scribbles on a prescription pad and hands it to Jim. 

FRED
(sarcastically)
Two of these a day should keep Mrs. Oinks-a-lot's existential dread at bay.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jim takes the prescription, clearly relieved.

JIM
Thanks, Fred. You're a lifesaver.

Jim exits, leaving Fred alone in the clinic.

FRED
(sighs)
Small town blues, Mrs. Oinks-a-lot. Small town blues.

Fred shakes his head, chuckling to himself.

FADE OUT.
