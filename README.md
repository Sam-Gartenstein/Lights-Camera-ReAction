# ðŸŽ¬ Lights, Camera, ReAction Functions

This notebook builds a full **sitcom script generation pipeline** powered by **ReAct-based agents** â€” a powerful framework that combines **reasoning** (thinking through a problem) with **acting** (taking structured steps).

We start by **generating a sitcom concept** from creative keywords, then **outlining** the pilot episode scene-by-scene.  
**Scene 1** is generated directly from the outline to establish the world and tone.  
After that, each new scene is **scripted, reviewed, and improved** using specialized **ReAct agents** â€” a **Character Agent**, **Comedy Agent**, and **Environment Agent** â€” that simulate a real sitcom writers' room.

âœ… **Benefits of using ReAct agents**:

- **More structured and transparent thinking:** Agents reason step-by-step before making edits.
- **Dynamic adaptation:** Agents flexibly plan the next creative moves based on scene history.
- **Better long-term coherence:** Scenes evolve logically, with tracked character growth, running jokes, emotional arcs, and worldbuilding.

After generation, each scene is **summarized and stored in a vector database**, enabling fast retrieval of scene metadata for future story planning.  
By combining **structured agent workflows** and **retrieval-augmented memory**, we bring sitcom worlds to life â€” one coherent, character-driven scene at a time.
