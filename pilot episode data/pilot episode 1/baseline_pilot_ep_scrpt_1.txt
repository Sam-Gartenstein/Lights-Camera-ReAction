# Scene 1

INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

FRANKIE, a slightly grizzled but spry locksmith with a twinkle in his eye, flips the sign on his shop door from "CLOSED" to "OPEN."

FRANKIE
(to himself)
Another day, another lock.

Just as he's about to settle behind the counter, the door swings open. In walks MRS. KAPLAN, a sweet old lady with a stubborn lock in her hand.

FRANKIE
(smiling)
Mrs. Kaplan! Nice to see you again. Having trouble with that lock?

MRS. KAPLAN
(playfully)
Frankie, you know this old thing is more temperamental than my late husband.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie chuckles and takes the lock from her, examining it expertly.

FRANKIE
(looking at the lock)
I think I've seen tougher nuts at a squirrel convention.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Just as Frankie starts working on the lock, a YOUNG GUY in a suit walks in, looking lost.

YOUNG GUY
(awkwardly)
Hi, I... I locked myself out of my car.

FRANKIE
(raising an eyebrow)
On a Sunday morning? You must have been eager to get to church.

[LAUGH TRACK]

YOUNG GUY
(defensively)
Actually, I was going to a yoga class.

FRANKIE
(amused)
Well, there's more than one way to find inner peace, I guess.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Just as Frankie hands Mrs. Kaplan her now fixed lock, the door chimes again. In walks a GRUFF COP with a pair of handcuffs.

GRUFF COP
(gruffly)
Frankie, I need a key for these cuffs. Lost the original during a chase.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
You're not planning to use these on me, are you, officer?

[LAUGH TRACK]

The Gruff Cop chuckles as Frankie goes behind the counter to find the right key.

FRANKIE
(to all)
Alright folks, one at a time. There's enough of Frankie to go around!

[LAUGH TRACK]

As Frankie bustles around his shop, helping each customer with their unique lock troubles, the scene ends with him in his element - surrounded by locks, keys, and people who rely on him.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 2 ###
INT. NEW YORK CITY BUS TERMINAL - DAY

ISABELLA, a bright-eyed young woman with a huge backpack, steps off the bus. She looks around, awed by the hustle and bustle of the city.

ISABELLA
(to herself)
New York, here I come.

She confidently strides towards the exit but suddenly trips over a suitcase, sprawling on the floor. She quickly gets up, brushing herself off and looking around to see if anyone noticed.

[LAUGH TRACK]

ISABELLA
(smiling awkwardly)
Great start, Isabella.

Just then, a TAXI DRIVER, brash and street-smart, rushes past her, knocking her off balance again.

TAXI DRIVER
(hurriedly)
Outta the way, lady!

ISABELLA
(defensively)
Hey, I'm walking here!

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella, a little shaken, dusts herself off and walks outside to hail a cab. A taxi pulls up, and the driver is the same guy who knocked her over.

ISABELLA
(sarcastically)
Well, isn't this a small city?

TAXI DRIVER
(chuckles)
Welcome to New York, kid.

As Isabella gets into the cab, she takes one last look at the bus terminal before they drive off.

ISABELLA
(to herself)
This is it, Isabella. This is your new beginning.

Just then, the taxi driver abruptly stops, throwing Isabella forward. 

TAXI DRIVER
(angrily)
Hey, watch it!

A SQUIRREL runs across the street, causing a traffic jam. Isabella watches in disbelief.

ISABELLA
(surprised)
A squirrel? In the middle of Manhattan?

TAXI DRIVER
(shrugs)
Welcome to the jungle, kid.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella, still reeling from the unexpected chaos, sighs and leans back in the seat.

ISABELLA
(resigned)
I guess this is my new normal now.

The cab drives off into the NYC traffic, leaving the chaos of the squirrel behind.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 3 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - AFTERNOON

The shop is busy with customers. Frankie is at the counter, helping a HIPSTER with a vintage lock. The door chimes and in walks ISABELLA, still wearing her backpack, looking desperate and out of place.

FRANKIE
(without looking up)
Be with you in a sec.

Isabella looks around the shop, recognizing it from her childhood. She approaches the counter.

ISABELLA
(nervously)
Actually, I'm not a customer.

Frankie looks up, surprised.

FRANKIE
(squinting)
Isabella?

ISABELLA
(awkwardly)
Hi, Dad.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie, taken aback, walks around the counter and hugs Isabella tightly.

FRANKIE
(teary-eyed)
What are you doing here? I haven't seen you since...

ISABELLA
(cutting him off)
I know, Dad. It's been a while.

Frankie releases her and looks at her backpack.

FRANKIE
(concerned)
You're not in trouble, are you?

ISABELLA
(defensively)
No, Dad. I just... I need a job.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie looks at her, surprised.

FRANKIE
(happily)
Well, it just so happens I could use some help around here.

Isabella looks relieved.

ISABELLA
(relieved)
Really? Thank you, Dad.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Just don't expect me to go easy on you.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella smiles, feeling a bit more hopeful. Just then, the Hipster interrupts them.

HIPSTER
(impatiently)
Excuse me, but could you hurry up with my lock?

Frankie turns to him, grinning.

FRANKIE
(amused)
Hold your horses, son. Family reunion in progress.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie and Isabella share a laugh, hinting at a potential new chapter for their relationship.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 4 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Frankie is busy at the counter, fiddling with a lock. Isabella is tidying up, reorganizing some keys and locks on display. She keeps glancing at Frankie, who seems oblivious to her efforts.

ISABELLA
(trying to sound casual)
You know, Dad, there's a system to organization.

FRANKIE
(without looking up)
And there's a system to lock-picking too. 

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella rolls her eyes and continues organizing.

ISABELLA
(muttering to herself)
Yes, a system from the stone age...

[LAUGH TRACK]

Just then, a CUSTOMER walks in with a suitcase.

CUSTOMER
(looking frazzled)
I need this suitcase open ASAP. Lost the key.

FRANKIE
(smiling)
You're in luck! That's my specialty.

Frankie takes the suitcase and starts working on it. Isabella looks at the queue forming outside.

ISABELLA
(concerned)
Dad, we need to manage this better.

Frankie looks up, confused.

FRANKIE
(raising an eyebrow)
What do you mean?

ISABELLA
(pointing outside)
Look at that line. We need a ticketing system or something.

Frankie chuckles.

FRANKIE
(amused)
Ticketing system? This isn't the DMV, Bella.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella crosses her arms, frustrated.

ISABELLA
(defensively)
Well, at least they have a system!

Frankie shrugs and goes back to the lock.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
You sure you don't want to work there instead?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella sighs and walks outside to manage the queue.

ISABELLA
(resigned)
No, but at this rate, I might as well.

[LAUGH TRACK]

FADE OUT.

### Scene 5 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - AFTERNOON

The shop is bustling with activity. FRANKIE is engrossed in picking a lock for a flustered BUSINESSMAN. ISABELLA is at the back, trying to set up a makeshift ticketing system. The door chimes and in walks GARY, Frankie's parole officer, looking out of place.

GARY
(smiling)
Frankie, my favorite locksmith.

[LAUGH TRACK]

FRANKIE
(looking up, surprised)
Gary! What brings you here?

GARY
(shrugging)
Just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd check in.

Frankie raises an eyebrow, skeptical.

FRANKIE
(suspicious)
You don't "just check in", Gary.

[LAUGH TRACK]

GARY
(laughing)
Alright, alright. I need a new key for my office. Lost the old one.

ISABELLA
(interjecting)
We're swamped, Gary. You'll have to take a number.

Gary looks over at the makeshift ticketing system, amused.

GARY
(snickering)
What is this, the post office?

[LAUGH TRACK]

ISABELLA
(defensively)
It's better than having people barge in and skip the queue!

GARY
(teasing)
Well, aren't you the little boss lady?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella crosses her arms, annoyed.

ISABELLA
(annoyed)
I'm just trying to keep things organized.

FRANKIE
(chuckles)
Don't mind her, Gary. She's just trying to modernize the stone age.

Gary laughs and takes a ticket from Isabella's system, looking at it curiously.

GARY
(smiling)
Well, I never thought I'd see the day. A ticket system in Frankie's locksmith shop.

Isabella grins, proud of her system. Frankie rolls his eyes and goes back to the lock.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
You'll get used to it. Just like we're getting used to her.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Gary chuckles and takes a seat, waving his ticket.

GARY
(joking)
I'll be waiting, Frankie. Don't keep your parole officer waiting too long.

Frankie laughs, shaking his head as he returns to his work. Isabella smiles, satisfied that her system is working.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 6 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON

Isabella is at the counter, helping a YOUNG WOMAN with a broken lock. Frankie is at the back, watching Isabella struggle to fix the lock.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
You sure you don't need any help, Bella?

ISABELLA
(defensively)
I've got it, Dad!

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie chuckles and goes back to his work. Isabella continues to struggle with the lock, growing increasingly frustrated.

ISABELLA
(to herself)
This stupid lock...

[LAUGH TRACK]

The door chimes and in walks MRS. JENKINS, a sweet old lady.

MRS. JENKINS
(cheerfully)
Hello, Frankie!

FRANKIE
(beaming)
Mrs. Jenkins! Always a pleasure.

Isabella, still struggling with the lock, looks up.

ISABELLA
(surprised)
You know Mrs. Jenkins?

FRANKIE
(nodding)
Oh, yes. She's been coming here for years. 

ISABELLA
(smiling)
I remember you from when I was a kid, Mrs. Jenkins.

MRS. JENKINS
(sweetly)
And I remember you, dear. Always so full of energy.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella blushes and goes back to the lock. Mrs. Jenkins turns to Frankie.

MRS. JENKINS
(sincerely)
It's good to see you two working together, Frankie.

FRANKIE
(smiling)
It's been a long time coming, Mrs. Jenkins.

Isabella finally manages to fix the lock, looking triumphant.

ISABELLA
(proudly)
Done!

The Young Woman looks relieved and thanks her. Frankie claps, amused.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Well done, Bella. You're learning.

ISABELLA
(grinning)
Thanks, Dad.

Just then, the makeshift ticketing system falls over, scattering tickets everywhere.

ISABELLA
(sighing)
I guess it's back to the drawing board.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie chuckles as Isabella starts picking up the scattered tickets.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Maybe you should stick to locks, Bella.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella laughs, shaking her head.

ISABELLA
(resigned)
Maybe you're right, Dad.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 7 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON

Isabella is picking up the scattered tickets while Frankie is helping Mrs. Jenkins with a lock. Gary is still waiting, flipping through a magazine. 

GARY
(looking up)
You know, Frankie, I've been thinking...

FRANKIE
(warily)
That's always dangerous, Gary.

[LAUGH TRACK]

GARY
(smiling)
Very funny, Frankie. But listen, you've got a good thing going here. Busy shop, your daughter helping out...

Frankie nods, not looking up from the lock he's working on.

GARY
(continued)
But what if you did something to bring in more customers?

ISABELLA
(interjecting)
We're already swamped, Gary. 

GARY
(smiling)
Not like that, Bella. I'm talking about... a comedy night!

[LAUGH TRACK]

FRANKIE
(raising an eyebrow)
A comedy night? In a locksmith shop?

GARY
(grinning)
Why not? It's different. It's fun. It'll draw people in.

Frankie chuckles, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
And who's gonna perform, Gary? You?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Gary shrugs, smiling.

GARY
(defensively)
I've got a few jokes up my sleeve.

ISABELLA
(skeptical)
I bet they're all about keys and locks.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Gary laughs, nodding.

GARY
(joking)
Well, we've gotta keep it on brand, right?

Frankie shakes his head, amused. 

FRANKIE
(sincerely)
I'll think about it, Gary.

Gary grins, satisfied. 

GARY
(smiling)
That's all I ask, Frankie.

Isabella rolls her eyes, going back to picking up the tickets.

ISABELLA
(muttering)
A comedy night... at a locksmith shop...

[LAUGH TRACK]

FADE OUT.

### Scene 8 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON

Isabella is behind the counter, surrounded by piles of tickets, a notebook, and a laptop. Frankie is helping a MIDDLE-AGED MAN with a lock. Gary is still waiting, now asleep in the corner. 

ISABELLA
(to herself)
Okay, so if we have the stage over here...

She points to a corner of the shop, then looks at her notebook, frowning.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Planning a comedy night, Bella?

[LAUGH TRACK]

ISABELLA
(defensively)
Someone has to, Dad!

Frankie chuckles, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(sincerely)
Just remember, we're a locksmith shop first.

ISABELLA
(rolling her eyes)
I know, Dad.

Frankie goes back to the lock, smiling. Isabella continues to plan, growing increasingly frustrated.

ISABELLA
(sighing)
How am I supposed to fit a stage in here?

[LAUGH TRACK]

The door chimes and in walks MARGARET, a lively woman in her sixties.

MARGARET
(cheerfully)
Hello, Frankie!

FRANKIE
(beaming)
Margaret! Always a pleasure.

Margaret looks over at Isabella, amused.

MARGARET
(smiling)
Planning a party, Isabella?

ISABELLA
(sighing)
Trying to, Margaret.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Margaret chuckles and turns to Frankie.

MARGARET
(teasing)
You've got her working hard, Frankie.

FRANKIE
(grinning)
She's got herself working hard, Margaret.

[LAUGH TRACK]

GARY
(grinning)
Having fun, Bella?

ISABELLA
(sarcastic)
Oh, a blast, Gary.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Gary chuckles, laying back down. Isabella sighs, looking at her notebook.

ISABELLA
(resigned)
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

Frankie looks up from the lock, smiling.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
I told you to stick to locks, Bella.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella laughs, shaking her head.

ISABELLA
(smiling)
Maybe you're right, Dad.

Suddenly, the door chimes and in walks JAMES, a young businessman, looking confused.

JAMES
(puzzled)
Am I in the right place? I need a key duplicated.

ISABELLA
(surprised)
Oh, yes, you're at the right place. Just a bit...different today.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie looks up from the lock, smiling.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
You've walked into our upcoming comedy night, James.

James looks around the shop, looking more confused.

JAMES
(confused)
Comedy night? At a locksmith shop?

ISABELLA
(defensive)
It was Gary's idea.

James looks at the sleeping Gary, then back at Isabella.

JAMES
(skeptical)
That guy's idea?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella nods, trying not to laugh.

ISABELLA
(smiling)
Yes, that guy.

James shakes his head, amused.

JAMES
(joking)
Well, if the comedy is as good as your key duplication, I might come back.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie chuckles, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Careful, James. You might end up being the opening act.

[LAUGH TRACK]

James laughs, handing Isabella his key.

JAMES
(smiling)
I'll stick to my day job, thanks.

Isabella takes the key, grinning.

ISABELLA
(sincerely)
Good call, James.

(to himself)
Comedy night at a locksmith shop...

GARY
(clears throat)
Alright, folks. I guess it's time for our first ever... Locksmith Comedy Night!

[LAUGH TRACK]

Gary takes a deep breath and starts his first joke.

GARY
(continued)
Why don't we trust keys?

Awkward silence.

GARY
(continued, forcing a laugh)
Because they always jingle their way out of trouble!

[LAUGH TRACK]

More silence. Gary's smile fades slightly.

GARY
(continued)
Okay, okay, how about this one? Why did the key go to school?

Another pause. Gary looks nervous.

GARY
(continued, forcing a chuckle)
Because it wanted to be a master... key!

More silence. Gary's smile fades completely. 

GARY
(muttering)
Tough crowd...

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella looks at Frankie, both of them trying not to laugh.

ISABELLA
(whispering)
Should we stop him?

FRANKIE
(suppressing a chuckle)
Let's give him a chance, Bella.

They look back at Gary who's sweating now.

GARY
(nervously)
Okay, um, here's another one... What do you call a fish with no eyes?

Silence. Isabella and Frankie exchange a glance.

GARY
(continued, forcing a laugh)
Fsh!

An awkward chuckle comes from the audience. Gary looks relieved.

GARY
(enthusiastically)
Alright, I think I'm getting the hang of this!

[LAUGH TRACK]

Well, Bella, I think we've found our new headliner.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Gary has finished his set and is stepping off the stage, drenched in sweat. The audience claps politely. Frankie and Isabella are still behind the counter, chuckling. 

ISABELLA
(teasing)
Well, that was something, wasn't it?

FRANKIE
(laughing)
I've never seen a key joke fall so flat.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella smiles, looking at the stage.

ISABELLA
(sincerely)
Still, it was fun. It's nice to shake things up a bit.

Frankie nods, looking at his daughter.

FRANKIE
(smiling)
You did a good job, Bella.

Isabella looks surprised.

ISABELLA
(really?)
You think so?

Frankie nods, looking around the shop.

FRANKIE
(sincerely)
Yeah. This place needed a bit of life. And you brought it.

Isabella smiles, looking touched.

ISABELLA
(smiling)
Thanks, Dad.

There's a pause. Then Frankie looks at Isabella.

FRANKIE
(sincerely)
But don't forget what I said earlier. We're a locksmith shop first.

Isabella nods, looking serious.

ISABELLA
(sincerely)
I know, Dad. I won't forget.

Frankie smiles, patting her shoulder.

(smiling)
Good girl.

(grinning)
I came back for the comedy. Did I miss it?

[LAUGH TRACK]

ISABELLA
(teasing)
You're just in time for the encore, James.

James looks at the stage, then at Gary, who's now asleep in the corner.

JAMES
(skeptical)
That guy's the encore?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella and Frankie laugh, shaking their heads.

FRANKIE
(joking)
Well, we never said it was a good encore.

[LAUGH TRACK]

James laughs, shaking his head.

JAMES
(smiling)
I'll stick around for a bit then.

Frankie chuckles, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Just remember, James, we're a locksmith shop first.

James laughs, nodding.

JAMES
(smiling)
I'll remember that, Frankie.

As GARY finishes his joke, the crowd roars with laughter. ISABELLA and FRANKIE are behind the counter, exchanging amused glances. JAMES is at a table, his face red from laughing.

GARY
(reveling in the moment)
And that's why you should never tell a lock to keep a secret!

[LAUGH TRACK]

ISABELLA
(teasing)
Wow, who knew locksmith humor could be so... popular?

FRANKIE
(laughs)
It's all about the delivery, Bella.

Suddenly, Frankie stands up and walks towards the stage. Isabella looks surprised.

(surprised)
Dad? What are you doing?

FRANKIE
(grinning)
I think it's time for some real locksmith humor.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Because they always have a job to do!

[LAUGH TRACK]

The crowd roars with laughter. Isabella looks surprised.

ISABELLA
(to herself)
Wow, Dad's got jokes!

Frankie grins, soaking in the applause.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Okay, okay, here's another one. Why did the locksmith break up with his girlfriend?

The crowd leans in, laughing already.

FRANKIE
(continued)
Because she had too many hang-ups!

[LAUGH TRACK]

More laughter. Frankie looks at Isabella, winking.

FRANKIE
(grinning)
And this one's for my daughter. Why don't keys ever get lost?

Isabella raises an eyebrow, curious. The crowd chuckles, waiting for the punchline.

FRANKIE
(continued)
Because they always know where the lock is!

[LAUGH TRACK]

The crowd roars with laughter. Isabella shakes her head, laughing.

ISABELLA
(shaking her head)
I can't believe this.

Frankie steps off the stage, the crowd clapping and laughing. He walks back to Isabella, grinning.

(teasing)
So, who's the headliner now?

Alright. Why did the key go to school?

The crowd leans in, curious. Frankie raises an eyebrow, intrigued.

FRANKIE
(amused)
I don't know, Gary. Why did the key go to school?

Gary grins, looking out at the crowd.

GARY
(continued)
Because it wanted to be a master key!

[LAUGH TRACK]

The crowd erupts in laughter. Even Isabella and Frankie are laughing. 

ISABELLA
(surprised)
Well, that's a new one.

Thank you, folks! You've been a great audience!

I guess people love locksmith humor.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Suddenly, the door chimes and in walks MARGARET, looking surprised.

MARGARET
(surprised)
What in heaven's name is going on here?

(laughs)
Welcome to the aftermath of our comedy night, Margaret!

You've turned a locksmith shop into a local hangout.

Frankie chuckles, nodding.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Well, who said locksmithing had to be boring?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Suddenly, a CUSTOMER approaches the counter, holding a lock.

CUSTOMER
(confused)
I heard a joke last night about this lock... something about a vacation?

Frankie, Isabella and Gary exchange amused glances.

FRANKIE
(grinning)
Ah, yes, that would be: Why don't locks ever go on vacation? Because they always have a job to do!

[LAUGH TRACK]

The customer laughs, nodding.

CUSTOMER
(smiling)
That's it! I'll take two.

Isabella rings up the sale, grinning.

ISABELLA
(teasing)
Who knew comedy could be good for business?

Frankie laughs, nodding.

FRANKIE
(joking)
Maybe we should start charging for jokes.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Gary chuckles, shaking his head.

GARY
(smiling)
Well, I guess I'll start working on my next set.

Isabella grins, nodding.

ISABELLA
(laughs)
Just keep it locksmith-related, Gary.

They all laugh as the shop continues to bustle with customers, the aftermath of their comedy night proving to be a success.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 16 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - LATE NIGHT

The shop is quiet, the aftermath of the comedy night has left a mess. ISABELLA is sweeping up while FRANKIE is behind the counter, counting the earnings for the day. 

ISABELLA
(tired)
Well, that was something.

FRANKIE
(smiling)
You did great, Bella. The shop was never this lively.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella stops sweeping, leaning on the broom. 

ISABELLA
(sincerely)
Thanks, Dad. But you were the star of the show.

Frankie laughs, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Well, locksmithing isn't all about keys and locks, you know.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella smiles, resuming her sweeping.

ISABELLA
(laughs)
Clearly, it's also about jokes and laughter.

Frankie nods, looking around the shop.

FRANKIE
(musing)
You know, Bella, this shop has been a part of our family for generations. 

ISABELLA
(looking at Frankie)
I know, Dad. And I'm proud to be a part of it.

Frankie smiles, looking at Isabella.

FRANKIE
(smiling)
I'm proud of you too, Bella. You've brought something new to this old shop.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella blushes, sweeping faster.

ISABELLA
(teasing)
Well, I learned from the best.

Frankie chuckles, putting away the cash box.

FRANKIE
(laughing)
That's my girl!

They share a moment, looking around the shop. 

ISABELLA
(smiling)
I think we make a good team, Dad.

Frankie nods, looking at Isabella.

FRANKIE
(sincerely)
I couldn't agree more, Bella.

They share a warm smile, the shop quiet and peaceful.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 17 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - DAY

The shop is quiet, a contrast from the previous day's hustle and bustle. FRANKIE is behind the counter, sorting through keys. ISABELLA is sweeping, the broom swishing softly against the floor. GARY is flipping through a joke book, a thoughtful look on his face.

GARY
(looking up)
Hey, what if we make the comedy night a regular event?

Frankie and Isabella stop what they're doing, looking at Gary.

FRANKIE
(doubtful)
Every night, Gary?

GARY
(grinning)
Maybe not every night. How about once a week?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella laughs, shaking her head.

ISABELLA
(teasing)
I'm not sure the world is ready for weekly locksmith humor, Gary.

Gary chuckles, shrugging.

GARY
(earnest)
Who knows, Bella? We might start a trend.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie grins, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(joking)
And then what? We'll be known as the locksmiths who tell jokes?

Gary nods, grinning.

GARY
(smiling)
Why not? It's unique. It sets us apart.

Isabella and Frankie exchange glances.

ISABELLA
(reluctant)
Well, it did bring in a lot of customers...

Frankie raises an eyebrow, looking at Gary.

FRANKIE
(skeptical)
Alright, Gary. We'll give it a try. But if I hear one more joke about keys...

Gary laughs, holding up his hands.

GARY
(defensive)
I promise, no more key jokes!

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella chuckles, shaking her head.

ISABELLA
(smiling)
We'll see about that, Gary.

They all laugh, the prospect of a regular comedy night making the locksmith shop a little more lively.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 18 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - NIGHT

Frankie and Isabella are locking up the shop, the store bathed in the soft glow of the setting sun. 

FRANKIE
(tired)
Well, we survived the aftermath.

ISABELLA
(laughs)
And we even agreed to do it again.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie chuckles, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
I must be getting soft in my old age.

Isabella grins, helping Frankie with the lock.

ISABELLA
(smiling)
Or maybe you're just embracing the fun side of locksmithing.

Frankie laughs, successfully locking up the shop.

FRANKIE
(joking)
Who knew there was a fun side?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella smiles, looking at the closed shop.

ISABELLA
(musing)
You know, Dad, I think we've unlocked something here.

Frankie looks at Isabella, raising an eyebrow.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Oh? And what's that?

Isabella chuckles, looking at Frankie.

ISABELLA
(smiling)
Our potential. As locksmiths, as a team, and as comedians.

Frankie chuckles, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(laughs)
Well, we'll see about the comedian part.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella grins, nudging Frankie.

ISABELLA
(teasing)
I think you're just afraid of being upstaged by Gary.

Frankie laughs, wrapping an arm around Isabella's shoulders.

FRANKIE
(amused)
Well, we can't have that, can we?

They both laugh, sharing a moment of quiet satisfaction and accomplishment. The shop, now closed, seems to echo their laughter, a testament to the day's success.

[LAUGH TRACK]

FADE OUT.

### Scene 19 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

The morning sun pours through the shop windows. FRANKIE is at the counter, examining a lock. ISABELLA is organizing keys, a cup of coffee steaming nearby.

ISABELLA
(smiling)
You know, I can't believe we're actually doing this comedy night.

FRANKIE
(grinning)
Neither can I, Bella. But it's a good thing, isn't it?

[LAUGH TRACK]

ISABELLA
(teasing)
Well, as long as Gary promises to keep the key jokes to a minimum.

FRANKIE
(laughs)
I think we can handle a few key jokes.

[LAUGH TRACK]

ISABELLA
(serious)
But dad, it's not just about the jokes. It's about us. This shop. We're not just locksmiths anymore.

Frankie looks at Isabella, setting down the lock.

FRANKIE
(sincerely)
You're right, Bella. We're more than that now.

They share a moment, looking around the shop.

ISABELLA
(smiling)
We've unlocked something, haven't we?

FRANKIE
(nods)
Yes, we have. And I'm proud of us.

[LAUGH TRACK]

ISABELLA
(teasing)
Even of Gary and his key jokes?

Frankie chuckles, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(laughs)
Especially of Gary and his key jokes.

[LAUGH TRACK]

They both laugh, sharing a warm moment in the quiet shop. Frankie looks at Isabella, a proud smile on his face.

FRANKIE
(smiling)
You know, Bella, you've really brought this shop to life. 

ISABELLA
(teasing)
Well, I learned from the best.

Frankie chuckles, looking around the shop.

FRANKIE
(smiling)
And I can't wait to see where we go from here.

They share a warm smile, the shop quiet and peaceful, brimming with unlocked potential.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 20 ###
INT. FRANKIE'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - AFTERNOON

Frankie and Isabella are busy at work, the shop filled with the sound of keys jingling and locks clicking. Suddenly, the door swings open, and GARY strolls in, a triumphant grin on his face.

GARY
(beaming)
Guess who just got their first stand-up gig?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie and Isabella look up, surprise on their faces.

FRANKIE
(amused)
Let me guess... the local key club?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Gary chuckles, shaking his head.

GARY
(proud)
Nope, the open mic at the coffee shop down the street!

Isabella grins, clapping her hands.

ISABELLA
(enthusiastic)
That's great, Gary! But promise us you won't use any key jokes.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Gary raises an eyebrow, crossing his arms.

GARY
(defensive)
What's wrong with key jokes? They're... unlockingly funny!

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie and Isabella both groan, shaking their heads.

FRANKIE
(teasing)
Gary, I think you just unlocked a whole new level of bad jokes.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Isabella laughs, patting Gary on the shoulder.

ISABELLA
(smiling)
Good luck, Gary. Break a lock.

Gary grins, nodding.

GARY
(proud)
Don't worry, I got this. Besides, who can resist a locksmith comedian?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Frankie chuckles, shaking his head.

FRANKIE
(joking)
Just remember, Gary. Don't lose your keys to comedy.

Gary laughs, heading towards the door.

GARY
(laughs)
Don't worry, Frankie. I've got them right here.

He pulls out a set of keys from his pocket, jingling them in the air before exiting the shop, leaving Frankie and Isabella laughing in his wake.

FADE OUT.
