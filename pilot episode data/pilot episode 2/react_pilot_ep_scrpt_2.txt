# Scene 1

INT. EARL'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - DAY

JIMMY, a spry man in his early 30s, is hunched over a workbench. He's engaged in a battle of wits with a particularly stubborn lock. He wears a greasy apron and a look of intense concentration.

JIMMY
(to the lock)
You've met your match, my friend.

Jimmy picks up a small file and begins to work on the lock. The door chimes as an elderly customer, MRS. O'BRIEN, enters.

MRS. O'BRIEN
Jimmy! I've locked myself out again!

JIMMY
(stands, grinning)
Mrs. Oâ€™Brien, you're my best customer.

[LAUGH TRACK]

MRS. O'BRIEN
Oh, Jimmy, you're such a sweet talker. 

Jimmy collects a key from the wall, labeled 'O'Brien - Spare'. 

JIMMY
Here you go, Mrs. O'Brien. 

He hands her the key.

MRS. O'BRIEN
Thank you, Jimmy. 

She takes out a tray of cookies from her bag.

MRS. O'BRIEN
Made some cookies for you. 

Jimmy takes a bite and grimaces.

JIMMY
(through a mouthful of cookie)
Mmm... crunchy.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Mrs. O'Brien leaves, Jimmy turns back to his workbench.

JIMMY
(to the lock)
Alright, where were we?

He picks up his file and goes back to work. 

The door chimes again and a YOUNG WOMAN enters. She looks around the shop, visibly impressed. 

YOUNG WOMAN
Wow, I've never seen so many keys in one place. 

JIMMY
(turns, grinning)
Well, then you've never been locked out of your life.

[LAUGH TRACK]

YOUNG WOMAN
(laughs)
Good one. I'm looking for a special key, it's for an antique cabinet.

Jimmy looks intrigued.

JIMMY
Well, let's see if we can't unlock your problem.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy turns back to his workbench, ready for the next challenge. The tone is set: this is a man who loves his work and his customers, and is always up for a good lock-related pun.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 2 ###
INT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jimmy is hunched over a complex-looking lock on his front door, brow furrowed in concentration. He turns a dial and pulls. Nothing. He jiggles a lever and pushes. Still nothing. 

JIMMY:
Well, this is about as easy as a vegan trying to order at a steakhouse. 

[Laugh Track]

From the couch, Tony watches, grinning, as he munches on popcorn.

TONY:
You know, Jim, if you spent half as much time cooking as you do on that lock, we wouldn't have that smoke alarm serenading us right now.

[Laugh Track]

Ignoring Tony, Jimmy pulls out his phone and dials a number. 

JIMMY:
(ON PHONE)
Hi, Mrs. O'Brien? Yes, it's Jimmy from across the hall... No, I didn't burn the place down... yet.

[Laugh Track]

Outside, a dog runs back and forth through an automated dog door, tail wagging happily.

JIMMY:
(ON PHONE)
I'm having some trouble with my lock. Any advice?

Tony, still on the couch, snickers.

TONY:
Maybe she can tell you how to turn off the smoke alarm too.

[Laugh Track]

Ignoring Tony, Jimmy continues to fumble with the lock. Suddenly, there's a loud snap, and the lock comes apart in his hands.

JIMMY:
Oops.

The loud noise startles a neighbor's cat, which bolts, knocking over a trashcan in its hurry to escape.

Just then, Mrs. O'Brien appears in the doorway. She's holding a bag of old locksmith tools.

MRS. O'BRIEN:
Heard a noise, thought I'd come see if you needed help.

She looks at the broken lock in Jimmy's hands and chuckles.

MRS. O'BRIEN:
Oh, Jimmy. I installed that lock system. Let me show you how it's done.

[Laugh Track]

She effortlessly unlocks the door, leaving Jimmy looking sheepish.

JIMMY:
Well, if all else fails, I could always get a dog and an automated dog door, right?

[Laugh Track]

Mrs. O'Brien chuckles and pats him on the shoulder as she walks away.

MRS. O'BRIEN:
Keep trying, Jimmy. You'll get it eventually.

As she leaves, Jimmy looks at the broken lock, then at Tony, who raises his popcorn in a toast.

TONY:
To learning new things, Jim.

[Laugh Track]

END OF SCENE

### Scene 3 ###
INT. JIMMY'S SHOP - DAY

[LISA enters, wrinkling her nose at the strong blend of aromas.]

LISA: Wow, Jimmy, you've got quite a...scent-uation going on here.

JIMMY: [Laughs] I call it eau de entrepreneurial spirit.

[LISA chuckles, making her way around the cluttered shop.]

[Laugh Track]

LISA: And I see you're still battling with the smoke alarm.

JIMMY: [Grinning] It's our love-hate relationship. I cook, it complains.

[Laugh Track]

[In the background, an elderly man struggles with a self-checkout machine.]

ELDERLY MAN: [Muttering] I just want to buy this jar of pickles...

LISA: [Chuckles] Some things never change, huh?

[Jimmy attempts to make a cup of coffee. The machine sputters and sprays him with hot water.]

JIMMY: [Yelps] And some things... [Wipes his face] apparently get worse.

[Laugh Track]

[LISA laughs, then becomes more serious.]

LISA: Jimmy, we need to talk about...

[JIMMY interrupts with a grin.]

JIMMY: ...our lock-y relationship? Because I think we've got the key to something great here.

[Laugh Track]

[LISA groans.]

LISA: Really, Jimmy? Lock puns?

JIMMY: [Shrugs] I find humor's the best key to... unlock... difficult conversations?

[Laugh Track]

[LISA shakes her head but is smiling.]

LISA: Some things never change.

[Scene Ends]

### Scene 4 ###
[Scene: Jimmy's Lock and Key Shop. LISA is setting up a small drone on the counter. JIMMY is behind the counter, struggling with a digital lock.]

LISA: (cheerfully) Jimmy, you need to embrace the future, like this drone here! 

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (grunts) I don't need no flying gizmo to replace good old-fashioned keys and locks, Lisa.

LISA: (determined) It's not about replacing, Jimmy. It's about adapting.

[JIMMY grumbles, fumbling with the digital lock.]

LISA: (concerned) You're holding it upside down.

JIMMY: (defensive) I knew that. I was just testing its, uh, reverse compatibility.

[Laugh Track]

[LISA chuckles, launching the drone. The drone buzzes around, knocking over a stack of old key blanks.]

LISA: (nervously) Oops! Still working out the kinks.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (sarcastically) Yeah, I can see that.

[LISA chases after the drone, but it continues to dart around.]

LISA: (desperate) Jimmy, help me catch it!

[JIMMY looks bemused but steps forward, opening the antique lock on the wall.]

JIMMY: (confident) Let me show you how it's done, tech whiz.

[The DRONE flies towards JIMMY, who swiftly traps it in the antique lock.]

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (grinning) How's that for adapting?

LISA: (surprised) Jimmy, that was...impressive.

JIMMY: (proud) Old dog, new tricks.

[LISA looks thoughtful.]

LISA: (determined) I think we can find a way to blend the old and new, Jimmy. But you'll have to meet me halfway.

[JIMMY sighs, looking at the trapped drone.]

JIMMY: (resigned) Fine. But only if you promise to keep that thing away from my key blanks.

LISA: (smiling) Deal.

[Laugh Track]

[End of Scene]

### Scene 5 ###
INT. STANLEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Stanley, a man with an eccentric flair, is immersed in arranging his Broadway posters. Lisa, a practical woman, is standing nearby, looking slightly irritated. Jimmy, a grounded and practical man, is working on a report at a desk on the other side of the room.

Stanley (flourishing a poster of 'Cats'): Ah, the lights, the music, the drama! There's nothing quite like Broadway, Lisa!

[Laugh Track]

Lisa (rolls eyes): Not everyone shares your enthusiasm, Stanley.

Stanley (oblivious to Lisa's annoyance): Do you remember 'Phantom of the Opera'? What a spectacle! 

Stanley begins to dramatically reenact a scene from the play.

[Laugh Track]

Lisa (trying to escape): Oh, look! I think Jimmy needs help with the smoke alarm.

Stanley (excited): 'Smoke Alarm'? Is that a new Broadway show? 

[Laugh Track]

Lisa (exasperated): No, Stanley! It's an actual smoke alarm. 

Stanley (ignoring Lisa's explanation): And there's 'Hamilton', 'Chicago', 'Wicked'! The list goes on!

Jimmy (interjects): Stanley, I think Lisa meant the actual smoke alarm. 

Stanley (still excited): Oh, a Broadway-themed smoke alarm! I must get one!

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy (shrugs at Lisa): You tried.

Lisa (sighs): Yes, I did.

[Laugh Track]

Stanley (starts singing a Broadway tune): And the show must go on!

Scene ends with Stanley continuing to sing, Lisa rolling her eyes and Jimmy shrugging his shoulders, accepting the eccentricities of Stanley.

THE END

### Scene 6 ###
INT. STANLEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Stanley, a flamboyant parole officer with a flair for Broadway, struggles with the lock on his desk drawer. Broadway memorabilia is strewn about his office. A miniature Broadway marquee sign blinks erratically on the corner of his desk. He taps it occasionally, trying in vain to steady the light.

STANLEY:
(under his breath)
Come on, you stubborn... 

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy, a recently paroled, stoic man with a patient demeanor, knocks on the door frame. 

JIMMY:
Having trouble, Stanley?

STANLEY:
Oh, Jimmy! Just wrestling with the critics here. You know, they can be such a pain.

[Laugh Track]

Stanley gestures at the blinking marquee sign and the locked drawer.

JIMMY:
Right... critics. Anyway, about my parole terms...

Stanley, finally prying open the drawer, pulls out a Broadway playbill and holds it like a precious artifact.

STANLEY:
Ah, yes! Your parole terms... Let's see, imagine if you will, you are the leading man in a production. 

Stanley stands and starts to stride around the room dramatically.

STANLEY:
(continuing)
Your parole officer, that's me, is your director. The terms of your parole, those are your lines, your stage directions.

Jimmy raises an eyebrow but doesn't interrupt.

STANLEY:
(continuing)
If you forget a line or miss a cue - that's a violation of your parole. 

Stanley picks up a stapler, using it as a prop to illustrate his point.

STANLEY:
(continuing)
This stapler, for example, could be a curfew, or a requirement to check in with me regularly. 

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy, clearly confused but patient, nods slowly.

JIMMY:
Okay... so, the stapler is my curfew.

Stanley, delighted, claps his hands.

STANLEY:
Exactly! And if you stay within the boundaries of the script - your parole terms - you'll receive a standing ovation from the audience, so to speak.

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy smiles, shaking his head.

JIMMY:
You sure have a unique way of explaining things, Stanley.

Stanley bows, still holding the playbill.

STANLEY:
Why, thank you, Jimmy. In the words of Shakespeare, "All the world's a stage..."

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy stands, ready to leave.

JIMMY:
And all the men and women merely players. I got it, Stanley. Thanks.

Stanley, left alone in his office, smiles at the playbill in his hand. 

STANLEY:
(to himself)
Ah, the smell of the greasepaint, the roar of the crowd...

[Laugh Track]

FADE OUT.

### Scene 7 ###
INT. LOCKSMITH WORKSHOP - DAY

[JIMMY, a middle-aged man with a fondness for tradition, is laying out an array of old locksmithing tools on a well-worn wooden table. LISA, a young woman with a penchant for modernity, watches with a bemused smile.]

JIMMY: (with pride) This, Lisa, is a quintessential locksmith's arsenal. Each tool, a classic novel, ready to unlock a story.

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (pulls out a sleek modern lock-picking set) So, I guess this is my Kindle version then?

[Laugh Track]

[JIMMY looks at LISA's set with disdain.]

JIMMY: (sniffs) There's something to be said about the smell of old metal and the feel of a well-worn tool in your hand. It's like holding a first edition Hemingway.

LISA: (misunderstanding) Oh! So you want me to smell these?

[Laugh Track]

[JIMMY shakes his head, amused.]

JIMMY: (explaining) No, Lisa. It's like... you're about to open Moby Dick. You need to feel the weight of the book, the texture of the pages. The tension wrench is your bookmark...

[LISA, looking confused, tries to mimic JIMMY's movements but botches it.]

LISA: (frustrated) This is ridiculous! It's 2022, Jimmy! There's an app for this!

[From the background, a drill fires up, then quickly stops. An APPRENTICE'S voice yells, "Oops! Wrong drill bit!"]

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (shakes head) Lisa, some things just can't be replaced by technology. It's about the craftsmanship, the art...

LISA: (interrupts) The time you're wasting?

[JIMMY sighs, but LISA is already attacking the lock with her modern tools. To JIMMY's surprise, she successfully picks the lock.]

LISA: (triumphant) And... VoilÃ ! Modernity wins!

[Laugh Track]

[LISA's triumph is short-lived, however, as the door swings shut behind them, automatically locking.]

LISA: (sheepishly) Um... Jimmy? Do you have an old-fashioned key for this?

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (smirking) So much for modernity, eh?

[End of Scene]

### Scene 8 ###
INT. OFFICE - DAY

Lisa is at her desk, explaining cloud storage to Jimmy who is visibly confused.

LISA: (patiently) So, Jimmy, instead of saving documents on your computer, you save them in the cloud.

JIMMY: (frowning) But how do they not get wet when it rains?

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (laughs) No, Jimmy. It's not a literal cloud. It's online storage.

Stanley, passing by, overhears the conversation and joins in.

STANLEY: (sarcastically) Ah, the cloud. Yet another way for the government to read our emails.

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (rolling her eyes) Stanley, not everything is a conspiracy.

In the background, an office worker is seen struggling with a new photocopier, paper flying everywhere. 

JIMMY: (pointing at the chaos) See, Lisa? That's why I stick to my typewriter.

[Laugh Track]

Lisa, trying to prove her point about the efficiency of modern technology, walks over to a high-tech coffee machine.

LISA: (confidently) Watch this. (to the machine) Coffee, black, two sugars.

The machine whirrs, then suddenly sputters and sprays coffee everywhere, drenching Lisa.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (grinning) Yeah, Lisa. I'll stick with my old coffee pot, thanks.

Stanley chuckles and pats Jimmy on the back.

STANLEY: (smiling) Good call, Jimmy. Old ways are the best ways.

Lisa, soaked and frustrated, sighs.

LISA: (resigned) Alright, you two win this round. But remember, technology is our friend.

She wipes coffee off her face as Jimmy and Stanley laugh.

[Laugh Track]

END OF SCENE

### Scene 9 ###
[Stanley enters Jimmy's apartment, struggling with a high-tech key. He finally manages to open the door, but in the process knocks over a stack of self-help books.]

Stanley: "Well, these books didn't help prevent that disaster!" [Laugh Track]

Jimmy: "Stanley, you always know how to make an entrance."

[Stanley dusts off a book, glancing at the title before placing it back on the stack.]

Stanley: "Well, Jimmy, every great Broadway show starts with a bang. Even if that bang is knocking over your 'Self-Help for Technophobes' book." [Laugh Track]

Jimmy: "Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. Not all of us are tech whizzes."

[Stanley, grinning, moves further into the apartment, narrowly avoiding stepping on Whiskers, who is attempting and failing to scale a bookshelf.]

Stanley: "Speaking of whizzes, Whiskers seems to be on a mission."

Jimmy: "Yeah, she's been trying to conquer that bookshelf all day. Persistent, isn't she?"

Stanley: "That's what we need, Jimmy. Persistence! Life is like a Broadway show, you know. You might flub a line or miss a cue. But the show must go on!"

Jimmy: "So, what? You're saying I need to get back on stage?"

Stanley: "Exactly! And I've got some ideas for you. How about competitive meditation? Or maybe extreme knitting?" [Laugh Track]

Jimmy: [Laughs] "Competitive meditation? How's that even a thing?"

Stanley: "Oh, you'd be surprised. You should see those monks go!" [Laugh Track]

[Stanley moves to the kitchen, sniffing appreciatively at the fresh cookies.]

Stanley: "Now, how about we sit down, enjoy these cookies, and discuss your 'encore'?"

[They both sit, Stanley picking up a cookie and taking a bite.]

Jimmy: "Alright, I'm listening. But if you suggest underwater basket weaving, I'm out." [Laugh Track]

Stanley: "Noted. But remember, Jimmy, even the understudy can become the star with the right attitude."

[Jimmy, inspired, playfully picks up a broom and starts acting out an impromptu Broadway scene.]

Jimmy: "And with a sweep of my broom, I clear away the past and make way for the future!" [Laugh Track]

Stanley: [Laughs] "That's the spirit, Jimmy! Now, let's get you back in the limelight."

[They both laugh, leaving the scene on a high note.]

### Scene 10 ###
INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

JIMMY, an old-fashioned shopkeeper, is fumbling with a new Point Of Sale (POS) system. LISA, a tech-savvy co-worker, watches with amusement.

JIMMY: (frustrated) This newfangled contraption is the devil's work, Lisa! Remember last week when it charged Mrs. Johnson a thousand bucks for a loaf of bread?

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (smiling) That was a user error, Jimmy. Mrs. Johnson got her refund, and she got a good laugh out of it, too.

JIMMY: (grumbling) I don't trust it. Give me my old cash register any day.

STANLEY, a quirky co-worker, walks in, sniffing the air appreciatively.

STANLEY: (dreamy) Ah, fresh bread. Nothing beats it. 

[Laugh Track]

As they talk, the grumpy shopkeeper in the background knocks over a stack of cans, causing a chain reaction of falling items. 

LISA: (looking at the mess) That wouldn't happen with an automated inventory system, Jimmy.

JIMMY: (defensive) That's not the point, Lisa!

A CUSTOMER walks in, awkwardly caught in the middle of their disagreement. 

JIMMY: (insistent) Watch this, Lisa. I'll handle this customer the old-fashioned way.

Jimmy attempts to use his old cash register, resulting in a series of humorous errors. Meanwhile, Stanley sneaks away for another taste of the fresh bread.

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (smirking) How's that working out for you, Jimmy?

STANLEY: (with mouth full of bread) You know, guys, we could just trade bread for goods. It's a conspiracy, money is just a societal construct!

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy and Lisa stare at Stanley, then burst into laughter. The tension eases.

JIMMY: (chuckling) Alright, Lisa. Let's settle this. Next week, we'll see who can run the store better - you with your gadgets, or me with my trusty cash register.

LISA: (grinning) You're on, Jimmy.

They shake hands, their friendly competition set for the next episode.

[Laugh Track]

END OF SCENE

### Scene 11 ###
INT. STANLEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Stanley's record player spins a Broadway tune in the background. His living room is adorned with Broadway memorabilia.

Stanley, an eccentric tech geek with a love for Broadway, is showing Jimmy, a technophobe, his latest gadget.

STANLEY
(trying to make a joke)
And this is the latest smartphone, Jimmy. It has more RAM than a sheep farm!

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy looks unimpressed. Stanley, undeterred, continues.

STANLEY
(getting the gadget to work)
You know, it's like that song from "The Phantom of the Opera."

Stanley starts to sing, getting the lyrics wrong.

STANLEY
(singing)
"The phantasm of the opera is here... inside your mind!"

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy laughs, shaking his head.

JIMMY
Stanley, you've got the lyrics all wrong. It's "Phantom," not "Phantasm."

Stanley looks at him with a broad smile, happy to see Jimmy laughing.

STANLEY
Well, as long as it got you smiling, my job here is done.

Stanley pats Jimmy's shoulder encouragingly.

STANLEY
(seriously)
Remember the song from "A Chorus Line", Jimmy? It goes, "I can do it, I can dare it, I can make my dream come true."

Jimmy looks thoughtful, absorbing Stanley's words.

STANLEY
(excited)
Just like those Broadway stars, you can conquer your fear of technology. You just have to dare it.

Stanley, caught up in his own enthusiasm, tries to imitate a dance move from "A Chorus Line" and stumbles, knocking over a small pile of Broadway records.

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy laughs heartily, his fear momentarily forgotten.

JIMMY
(laughing)
Stanley, you're a riot.

Stanley, still on the floor, laughs along with Jimmy.

STANLEY
(laughing)
And you, my friend, are one step closer to being a tech wizard.

They both share a laugh as the Broadway tune continues to play in the background.

[Laugh Track]

Stanley gets up, dusts himself off, and hands Jimmy the smartphone.

STANLEY
Now, let's conquer this sheep farm!

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy takes the smartphone, a new determination in his eyes.

### Scene 12 ###
INT. LOCAL BAR - NIGHT

[LISA, a tech-savvy young woman, is setting up a projector at a table. Her father, STANLEY, a traditionalist, is seated across from her. JIMMY, a sympathetic bar regular, is watching from the bar counter. The LOCAL BAND plays off-key in the background.]

LISA: (nervously)
Dad, I promise, this presentation will change your life. 

STANLEY: (skeptical)
The only presentation that changed my life was when your mom presented me with you. 

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (rolls her eyes)
Very funny, dad. But seriously, you need to modernize your office. 

STANLEY: (shrugs)
If it ain't broke...

LISA: (interrupts)
It is broke, dad. You're drowning in paperwork. It's time to embrace technology.

[LISA starts the presentation. An embarrassing childhood photo of her pops up.]

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (blushing)
Oops! Wrong slideshow. 

JIMMY: (grinning)
That's a great look for you, Lisa. 

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (smiling)
Thanks, Jimmy. 

[LISA quickly switches to the correct presentation.]

LISA: (passionate)
Look, dad, modernizing your office could simplify everything. 

STANLEY: (interrupts)
But what about tradition?

LISA: (sighs)
Tradition is important, dad, but so is progress. 

[LISA hands STANLEY a smartphone.]

LISA: (determined)
Here, let me show you.

[STANLEY looks at the smartphone like it's an alien object.]

[Laugh Track]

STANLEY: (stumbling over words)
"Click where now?"

[LISA guides STANLEY through the process. He starts to get the hang of it.]

STANLEY: (smiling)
Well, this isn't as hard as I thought. 

LISA: (smiling back)
See? It's not so bad, is it?

[STANLEY suddenly starts singing a popular Broadway song, but gets the lyrics wrong.]

STANLEY: (singing)
"The neon lights are bright... on Broadway!"

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (laughing)
Stanley, that's not how the song goes!

[Everyone laughs. STANLEY shrugs and grins.]

STANLEY: (grinning)
Well, it's my version!

[LISA and STANLEY continue to laugh and bond over the smartphone, with the LOCAL BAND playing their off-key tune in the background.]

### Scene 13 ###
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

[JIMMY, mid-50s, gruff and technologically challenged, is struggling to open an old locker with a hairpin. LISA, mid-30s, tech-savvy and patient, is watching. A ROOKIE COP is wrestling with a coffee machine in the background.]

JIMMY: (grunting) This blasted lock...

LISA: (laughing) Jimmy, you're not picking a lock in an old noir film. You need more than a hairpin.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (pulling out a rubber chicken from his pocket) Well, how about this?

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (laughs) No, Jimmy. That's not how it works. You need a digital lock-picking tool. 

JIMMY: (surprised) Digital what now?

LISA: (holding up her smartphone) It's an app. Here, let me show you.

[JIMMY pulls out a dusty, old smartphone from his pocket, surprising LISA.]

LISA: (laughing) Whoa, Jimmy! Is that a smartphone?

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (proud) Yeah, I've been trying to catch up with you young folks.

[JIMMY starts to fumble with his phone, struggling to unlock it.]

LISA: (grinning) You know, Jimmy, with your newfound tech skills, we could start a lock-picking YouTube channel.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (confused) YouTube? Is that one of those internet things?

LISA: (laughs) Yes, Jimmy. You're getting there.

[JIMMY finally unlocks his phone and starts to watch a lock-picking tutorial.]

JIMMY: (focused) Alright, let's see... insert tension wrench... apply pressure...

[LISA, watching JIMMY, starts to laugh.]

LISA: (laughing) Jimmy, you're using cop jargon. It's not a "tension wrench", it's a "torque screwdriver".

[Laugh Track]

[JIMMY, ignoring LISA, continues to follow the tutorial, and with a triumphant look, finally unlocks the locker.]

JIMMY: (grinning) Got it!

LISA: (clapping) Well done, Jimmy! You're officially a digital-age detective.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (laughing) Maybe we should start that YouTube channel after all.

LISA: (grinning) That's the spirit, Jimmy!

[They both laugh as the ROOKIE COP finally gets the coffee machine to work, showering himself in hot coffee.]

[Laugh Track]

END OF SCENE 13.

### Scene 14 ###
INT. NEIGHBORHOOD CAFÃ‰ - DAY

Jimmy is hunched over his phone, squinting at the screen. Lisa sits across from him, newspaper unfolded, both of them swatting at a persistent fly.

JIMMY:
(Looking at his phone)
Why does this app need access to my camera? I'm just trying to order coffee!

[Laugh Track]

LISA:
(Laughs, reading newspaper)
And why does this newspaper need two pages for obituaries? I just want the horoscopes!

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy finally presses a button on his phone. A loud DING echoes throughout the cafÃ©. The barista looks annoyed.

BARISTA:
(Shouts)
Who ordered ten caramel lattes?!

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy grimaces, fumbling with his phone. 

JIMMY:
(To Lisa)
Look, Lisa, I know I've been... a bit of a bear in a candy store lately.

LISA:
(Laughs)
You mean a bull in a china shop?

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY:
Yeah, that. I'm sorry, okay? 

Lisa softens, looking at Jimmy.

LISA:
I know, Jimmy. And I'm sorry too. I'm not exactly tech-savvy, am I?

They share a laugh as Jimmy's phone starts to VIBRATE uncontrollably on the table. 

JIMMY:
(Desperate)
How do I stop the coffee orders?!

[Laugh Track]

LISA:
(Laughs, stands up)
Here, let me show you.

They both stand near the phone. Lisa guides Jimmy through the app, their fingers brushing. 

LISA:
(Grinning)
How about this? I'll help you with the tech stuff, and you help me with... whatever this is.

She gestures at the newspaper. Jimmy chuckles.

JIMMY:
(Grins)
Deal. But remember, it's a friendly competition. No... bears in china shops.

Lisa laughs, rolling her eyes. 

LISA:
(Laughs)
Sure, Jimmy. No bears in china shops.

They both swat at the persistent fly, laughing. Their coffee arrives - ten caramel lattes.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY:
(Chuckles)
Well, we got plenty of practice rounds for our competition, eh?

They both laugh, raising their cups in a toast.

END OF SCENE

### Scene 15 ###
INT. STANLEY'S CHECK-IN - DAY

[Stanley, a charming old man with a twinkle in his eyes, is behind the counter. Lisa, a young, tech-savvy woman, and Jimmy, a casual coffee supplier, are standing in front of the counter.]

STANLEY: (gesturing at the caramel lattes) Jimmy, you know I can't take all of these off your hands, I run a check-in, not a coffee shop. 

JIMMY: (laughs) I know, Stanley. But you could use some for your guests, right?

[Lisa notices Stanley's predicament.]

LISA: (smiling at Stanley) You know, Stanley, you could use a coffee ordering app. It would solve your surplus problem.

STANLEY: (laughs) Oh, Lisa, I'm old school. I don't trust these newfangled tech things. 

[Laugh Track]

STANLEY: (to Jimmy) Now, let's make a deal. I'll take half your lattes, if you can name the Broadway musical that goes, "Coffee is the opiate of the masses!"

JIMMY: (laughs) I think you mean "religion" and "The Book of Mormon," Stanley.

[Laugh Track]

[Lisa and Jimmy share a laugh while Stanley looks puzzled.]

STANLEY: (laughs) Ah, you two are just adorable. Reminds me of my first date with Martha. Let me give you some advice...

LISA: (laughs) Stanley, we're not...

JIMMY: (laughs) Dating, Stanley. We're not dating.

[Laugh Track]

[Stanley's parrot squawks, "We're not dating!"]

[Stanley looks at his parrot, then back at Lisa and Jimmy.]

STANLEY: (laughs) Well, that's a relief. Now I don't have to share my tragic love stories.

[Laugh Track]

[Lisa takes out her phone and opens a coffee ordering app.]

LISA: (smiling) Stanley, let me show you how this works. It's really easy.

[Stanley's parrot squawks, mimicking the app's voice assistant, "Welcome to BrewBuddy!"]

STANLEY: (laughs) Well, would you look at that! I didn't even touch the thing and it's already working!

[Laugh Track]

[Lisa and Jimmy share a glance, then laugh.]

LISA: (laughs) That's right, Stanley. You're a natural.

[They all share a laugh as Stanley's parrot squawks, "You're a natural!" providing a playful end to the scene.]

### Scene 16 ###
INT. OFFICE - DAY

Lisa (holding a shiny new piece of tech) is standing with Jimmy, Stanley, and Bob.

LISA: Jimmy, meet your new office companion: The VoiceBox 3000! 

JIMMY: (eyeing the device skeptically) I don't trust machines.

LISA: (grinning) Is that so? Let's make it interesting: if this baby can increase our productivity by 20% this week, you have to admit that tech is superior.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (rolling his eyes) You're on.

Stanley overhears and looks worried.

STANLEY: Wait, if that thing's taking over, does that mean we're all out of a job?

[Laugh Track]

LISA: (laughing) No, Stanley. It's here to help, not replace us.

Suddenly, the VoiceBox 3000 starts speaking in a robotic voice.

VOICEBOX 3000: "Assist, not replace. Understood."

[Laugh Track]

Stanley looks relieved. 

Bob looks up from his computer, alarmed.

BOB: (panicking) Does that thing understand everything we say?

LISA: (smirking) Only when it's in listening mode, Bob. 

Bob looks relieved but suddenly, the customer feedback ticker pops up with an absurd comment: "Does it make coffee too?"

[Laugh Track]

Bob, seizing the opportunity, starts packing his things.

BOB: Well, if it can make coffee, I guess I can take the day off.

Lisa rolls her eyes while Jimmy laughs.

JIMMY: (grinning) Good luck with that, Bob.

Suddenly, the VoiceBox 3000 starts speaking again.

VOICEBOX 3000: "Taking the day off. Understood. Initiating 'vacation mode'."

Suddenly, all the computers in the office go into screensaver mode, causing chaos.

[Laugh Track]

Everyone starts laughing as Bob looks sheepishly around, grabs his things and heads towards a large packaging box in the corner.

LISA: (grinning) Well, I guess the VoiceBox 3000 does give us more free time.

Just as everyone's laughing dies down, they hear a noise from the box Bob disappeared into.

JIMMY: (grinning) Is that...?

Suddenly, Bob's head pops out of the box, looking sheepish.

BOB: (grinning) Guess I'm not as good at hide and seek as I thought.

[Laugh Track]

Everyone laughs as the scene ends.

### Scene 17 ###
INT. STANLEY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jimmy and Lisa sit on the couch, a deck of cards in Jimmy's hands. Stanley's parrot squawks in the background.

JIMMY:
So you just pick a card, any card.

LISA:
Alright, I'm ready to be amazed.

Jimmy shuffles the deck clumsily. Lisa picks a card and shows it to the audience.

JIMMY:
Now, put it back in the deck. 

Lisa does so. Jimmy messes with the deck for a moment, then pulls out a card.

JIMMY:
Is this your card?

LISA:
Nope.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY:
Oh, well. It's not an exact science.

LISA:
Actually, Jimmy, that's not how the saying goes.

JIMMY:
What do you mean?

LISA:
It's "It's not a perfect science." Not "exact."

JIMMY:
Oh, I didn't know that. Thanks for teaching me, Lisa.

Lisa smiles. The parrot squawks, "It's not an exact science!"

[Laugh Track]

LISA:
Let's switch gears. I want to show you something.

Lisa pulls out a tech gadget and starts to play a slideshow. Instead of their pictures, cat videos start to play.

JIMMY:
Wow, I didn't realize we encountered so many cats today.

[Laugh Track]

LISA:
Wait, these aren't our pictures. This gadget must be glitching.

JIMMY:
Or maybe it's just not an exact science.

[Laugh Track]

LISA:
You're catching on. Let me show you how to use this gadget.

Lisa starts explaining, but Jimmy struggles to follow along. 

JIMMY:
This is harder than the card trick.

The parrot squawks, "Not an exact science!"

[Laugh Track]

LISA:
Well, Jimmy, we've both learned something new today. 

They both laugh. Jimmy nods, looking at the still playing cat videos.

JIMMY:
Yes, and apparently, we've also become cat enthusiasts.

They both laugh again as the parrot squawks, "Cat enthusiasts!"

[End Scene]

### Scene 18 ###
INT. OFFICE - DAY

Stanley sits at his desk, buried in paperwork. Lisa enters, carrying a large box.

LISA: (excited) Stanley, I have a surprise for you!

STANLEY: (startled) Lisa, you know I hate surprises.

Lisa reveals a karaoke machine from the box. Stanley's eyes widen.

[Laugh Track]

STANLEY: (grinning) Well, this is a welcome surprise!

Lisa plugs in the machine. Stanley stands, taking the microphone. Jimmy walks in, surprised.

JIMMY: (laughs) Stanley, are you about to serenade us?

STANLEY: (mischievous) "The show must go wrong," Jimmy!

[Laugh Track]

Jimmy chuckles, shaking his head. Stanley starts singing off-key, causing everyone in the office to laugh.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY: (sarcastic) Well, Stanley, you're certainly no Julie Andrews!

The grumpy janitor walks in, grimacing at the noise.

JANITOR: (gruff) Sounds like a cat in a blender.

[Laugh Track]

Stanley, unfazed, continues singing. He picks up a stapler, using it as a prop microphone. Suddenly, he slips on a discarded playbill, falling onto a chair.

[Laugh Track]

Stanley laughs, picking himself up.

STANLEY: (joking) And they say Broadway is all glamour!

Lisa, Jimmy, and the rest of the team join Stanley, singing along. They laugh and cheer, turning the office into a makeshift Broadway stage.

LISA: (laughing) Stanley, you're a natural!

Stanley, grinning, takes a bow.

STANLEY: (proud) Thank you, thank you. I'll be here all week!

[Laugh Track]

The team claps, laughing and cheering as Stanley takes a final bow. He returns to his desk, resuming his work as if nothing happened.

STANLEY: (content) Just another day at the office.

Everyone laughs as the scene ends.

[Laugh Track]

### Scene 19 ###
INT. OFFICE - DAY

Jimmy stands by the perpetually malfunctioning coffee machine, a sign on it reads, "Out of Order... Again." Lisa enters, carrying a stack of files.

JIMMY:
Lisa, I've been meaning to talk to you.

LISA:
You're not about to confess your love, are you? Because I've been down that road with you before, Jimmy.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY:
No, not this time. I just wanted to say... you know... thank you.

LISA:
For what? Not falling for your love confession?

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY:
No, for... well, everything really. You've been a rock. A real... umm... you know... a real... life vest.

LISA:
A life vest, Jimmy?

JIMMY:
Yes, you know, something that... saves... people.

LISA:
I think you mean a lifesaver, Jimmy.

[Laugh Track]

JIMMY:
Yeah, that. You've been a real lifesaver, Lisa.

Lisa grins and shakes her head, amused.

LISA:
Well, Jimmy, I do what I can. And in this office, that means saving you from yourself most of the time.

[Laugh Track]

Suddenly, the coffee machine whirs to life, coffee pouring out.

JIMMY:
See, Lisa, I told you, it's not an exact science.

[Laugh Track]

Lisa chuckles, shaking her head.

LISA:
No, Jimmy, it really isn't. But thanks for the... umm... lifesaving recognition.

They share a laugh as they go to get their coffee, the malfunctioning machine finally working.

### Scene 20 ###
[The team is wrapping up for the day in their quirky shop, filled with the sound of the discordant wind chime near the door.]

CHARACTER A: [Grinning at Character B] So, remember that customer from this morning?

CHARACTER B: [Rolls eyes] Oh, the one with the unpronounceable coffee order?

[Laugh Track]

CHARACTER A: [Laughs] Yeah, that one! You looked like you were trying to solve a Rubik's cube!

CHARACTER B: [Smiling] Well, I think I've finally cracked the code. No more coffee conundrums for me!

[Laugh Track]

CHARACTER C: [To Character D, sincerely] You know, I really appreciated your help with that difficult customer today.

CHARACTER D: [Smiling] Anytime, pal. That's what friends are for.

CHARACTER A: [Looking around] Hey, where's Bill?

CHARACTER B: [Shrugs] Maybe he's cleaning... something.

[Laugh Track]

CHARACTER D: [Jokingly] Or he's lost in his own mop bucket.

[Laugh Track]

[They all start looking around, the discordant wind chime near the door jangling as they open and close it during their search.]

CHARACTER C: [Opening the storage room door] Found him!

[Bill is seen inside, dusting a shelf.]

BILL: [Surprised] Oh! I didn't realize I'd locked myself in.

[Laugh Track]

JENNY: [Entering, wearing mismatched shoes] What's all the commotion about?

CHARACTER A: [Points at Jenny's shoes, laughing] Jenny, you've got a red and a blue shoe on!

JENNY: [Looking down, laughing] Well, I guess that's one way to make a fashion statement!

[Laugh Track]

[They all share a laugh, the discordant wind chime punctuating the moment.]

CHARACTER B: [Smiling] Just another day in our wonderfully quirky shop.
