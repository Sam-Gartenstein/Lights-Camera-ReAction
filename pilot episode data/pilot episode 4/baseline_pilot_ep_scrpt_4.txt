# Scene 1

INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

JIMMY, a burly ex-con with a heart of gold, is carefully arranging various lock sets on a display shelf. His large hands struggle with the delicate task.

JIMMY
(to himself)
Easy does it, Jimmy. You're not wrestling a cellmate for the bottom bunk anymore.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy steps back, admiring his work. Then, he bumps into another shelf behind him, causing a cascade of keys to clatter onto the floor.

JIMMY
(sighs)
Well, that's one way to make a key drop.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Suddenly, the front door swings open. A gust of wind sweeps through, blowing Jimmy's carefully arranged locks off the shelf. 

JIMMY
(grumbles)
I should've stuck with the prison laundry business.

[LAUGH TRACK]

A small, elderly WOMAN enters, squinting at the chaos.

WOMAN
(pointing)
Is this where I can get some keys copied?

JIMMY
(defeated)
Sure is, ma'am. Just give me a second to find them.

Jimmy starts picking up keys from the floor. The woman looks around, pulling a large set of keys from her purse.

WOMAN
And, do you think you could help me find the key to my heart? I've seemed to misplace it.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy looks up, surprised, then chuckles warmly.

JIMMY
(smiling)
I think I can handle that, ma'am.

They share a laugh as Jimmy starts picking up the keys, setting the tone for the series of human connections Jimmy will make in his new locksmith shop.

### Scene 2 ###
# Scene 2

INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Just as Jimmy finishes picking up the keys, the door swings open again. SAMANTHA, a young woman with a rebellious streak and a business school dropout, enters. She looks at Jimmy, her eyes filled with a mix of nervousness and determination.

SAMANTHA
(awkwardly)
Hey, dad.

JIMMY
(surprised)
Samantha? What are you doing here? 

SAMANTHA
(sighs)
I dropped out of business school.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy looks taken aback, not knowing how to respond.

JIMMY
(stammering)
You did what?

SAMANTHA
(defensive)
Yeah, I didn't like it. It was boring. All those numbers and theories. I just... I just couldn't do it.

JIMMY
(confused)
But, what about your future? 

SAMANTHA
(shrugs)
Maybe my future isn't in business, dad. Maybe it's... 

She hesitates, glancing around the shop.

SAMANTHA
(continuing)
...maybe it's here.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy's surprise turns to disbelief.

JIMMY
(incredulous)
Here? In a locksmith shop? 

SAMANTHA
(defiant)
Why not? You seem to like it. 

Jimmy looks at Samantha, then at the mess on the floor. He shrugs, a small smile playing on his lips.

JIMMY
(smiling)
Well, if you don't mind picking up keys...

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha rolls her eyes, but a hint of a smile can be seen on her face too. They share a moment, the tension easing slightly.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
I guess I can handle that.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha starts picking up keys, joining Jimmy on the floor. The room fills with the clattering of keys, and a new chapter of their lives begins in the locksmith shop.

### Scene 3 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

The shop is in a bit of disarray from the previous key drop. Samantha is helping Jimmy pick up the keys, while Jimmy is still trying to process her unexpected decision.

JIMMY
(skeptical)
You sure about this, Samantha?

SAMANTHA
(confident)
Positive. I mean, how hard could running a locksmith shop be?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy gives Samantha a look that says, "You have no idea."

JIMMY
(ironic)
Oh, you'd be surprised.

Samantha stops picking up keys and stands up, dusting off her jeans.

SAMANTHA
(serious)
Dad, I'm serious. I want to help you run this place. 

Jimmy looks at Samantha, surprised.

JIMMY
(surprised)
You want to... help?

SAMANTHA
(determined)
Yes. I may not know much about locks, but I know a thing or two about business. I mean, I did attend business school.

JIMMY
(dryly)
For a semester...

[LAUGH TRACK]

SAMANTHA
(defensive)
Hey, it's more than you ever did!

Jimmy chuckles, shaking his head.

JIMMY
(amused)
That's true. 

Suddenly, Samantha looks serious.

SAMANTHA
(serious)
So, what do you say, dad? Partners?

Jimmy looks at Samantha, then at the mess on the floor, then back at Samantha. He sighs.

JIMMY
(serious)
Alright. But you're on key duty.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha grins, rolling up her sleeves.

SAMANTHA
(smirking)
Deal.

They shake hands, sealing the deal. As Samantha goes back to picking up keys, Jimmy watches her, a proud smile on his face.

JIMMY
(to himself)
My little girl, running a locksmith shop...

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy shakes his head, still smiling, and goes back to helping Samantha pick up the keys. The room fills with the clattering of keys, and a new chapter of their lives begins in the locksmith shop. 

FADE OUT.

### Scene 4 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

The shop is still in disarray from the key drop. Samantha and Jimmy are on the floor, surrounded by keys. Samantha is carefully sorting keys into piles, while Jimmy is still picking up. Suddenly, the door swings open. TERRY, a middle-aged man with a clipboard and a quirky sense of humor, walks in.

TERRY
(playfully)
Well, well, well. If it isn't my favorite ex-con.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy looks up, surprised. 

JIMMY
(startled)
Terry! What are you doing here?

TERRY
(smirking)
Just making my rounds. And by the looks of it, you're keeping busy.

He gestures towards the mess of keys on the floor.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha looks up, curious.

SAMANTHA
(confused)
Who's this?

Jimmy gets up, dusting off his hands.

JIMMY
(amused)
Samantha, meet Terry, my parole officer.

Samantha raises an eyebrow at Terry.

SAMANTHA
(sarcastic)
Oh, great. Just what this shop needs. More keys.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Terry laughs, extending a hand towards Samantha.

TERRY
(delighted)
Nice to meet you, Samantha. And don't worry, I'm not here to add to your mess.

He looks at the keys on the floor, then back at Jimmy.

TERRY
(teasing)
Although, I could use a new set of keys...

Jimmy rolls his eyes, grinning.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Terry, you've got enough keys to unlock the city.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Terry chuckles, nodding.

TERRY
(agreeing)
True. But a man can never have too many keys.

Samantha shakes her head, chuckling. Terry looks at her, then at Jimmy.

TERRY
(smiling)
Well, I'll leave you two to your... key business. 

He heads towards the door, then turns back.

TERRY
(winking)
And remember, Jimmy. No lock picking.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy chuckles, waving Terry off.

JIMMY
(laughing)
I'll remember, Terry.

Terry exits, leaving Jimmy and Samantha in the shop. They look at each other, then back at the mess on the floor.

SAMANTHA
(sighs)
Well, back to it.

They go back to picking up keys, the room filling with the clattering of keys once again. 

FADE OUT.

### Scene 5 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

The locksmith shop is slowly getting back in order. Jimmy is at the counter with various locksmithing tools spread out. Samantha is at the cash register, struggling with a stubborn lock.

JIMMY
(eyeing Samantha)
You know, Samantha, there's more to locksmithing than just forcing a lock open.

SAMANTHA
(frustrated)
I've got it, dad.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy chuckles, shaking his head. He gets up and walks over to Samantha.

JIMMY
(amused)
Here, let me show you.

Jimmy takes the lock from Samantha and starts explaining the mechanism.

JIMMY
(serious)
See, each lock is like a puzzle. You've got to find the right combination to unlock it.

Samantha watches, fascinated.

SAMANTHA
(interested)
That's actually pretty cool.

JIMMY
(grinning)
Told you. It's not just about keys.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy hands the lock back to Samantha. She tries to unlock it, but ends up dropping it.

SAMANTHA
(flustered)
Oops.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy chuckles, bending down to pick up the lock.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Smooth move, partner.

Samantha rolls her eyes but smiles. Jimmy hands her the lock again.

JIMMY
(paternal)
Try again, kiddo.

Samantha takes a deep breath and starts to fiddle with the lock again.

Suddenly, the door swings open. A CUSTOMER, a woman in her 40s with a frantic look, enters.

CUSTOMER
(desperate)
Please, I need a locksmith!

Jimmy and Samantha look at each other, then back at the customer.

JIMMY
(smiling)
You've come to the right place.

Samantha grins, holding up the lock.

SAMANTHA
(smirking)
And we've got just the right lock for you.

[LAUGH TRACK]

FADE OUT.

### Scene 6 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Jimmy and Samantha are at the counter, the CUSTOMER standing anxiously on the other side. Samantha is still holding the lock from before.

CUSTOMER
(panicked)
I've locked myself out of my house, my cat's inside and I think I left the stove on!

[LAUGH TRACK]

JIMMY
(reassuring)
Don't worry, ma'am. We'll get you back inside in no time.

Samantha hands Jimmy the lock she was holding, still trying to open it.

SAMANTHA
(proud)
And look, dad, I've almost got this one.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy takes the lock, looking at it with a bemused expression.

JIMMY
(teasing)
That's great, Samantha, but we're not going to need it to unlock her house.

SAMANTHA
(defensive)
I know that, dad. I was just practicing.

Jimmy chuckles, turning his attention back to the Customer.

JIMMY
(sincere)
Alright ma'am, do you have a spare key?

CUSTOMER
(worried)
No, I don't... That's why I'm here.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy nods, grabbing a set of lock picking tools from behind the counter.

JIMMY
(reassuring)
No problem. We'll get you back in your house, and then we can make a spare key for you.

The Customer looks relieved.

CUSTOMER
(grateful)
Oh, thank you so much!

Samantha looks at the lock picking tools, intrigued.

SAMANTHA
(curious)
Can I try?

Jimmy looks at Samantha, then at the Customer, then back at Samantha.

JIMMY
(skeptical)
You sure about this?

SAMANTHA
(confident)
Positive. I mean, how hard could it be?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy hands Samantha the lock picking tools, a smile on his face.

JIMMY
(amused)
Alright, partner. Show us what you've got.

Samantha grins, excitement in her eyes.

SAMANTHA
(determined)
You bet I will.

The Customer watches as Samantha starts working on an imaginary lock with the tools. Jimmy watches her, a proud smile on his face.

JIMMY
(to himself)
My little girl, picking locks...

[LAUGH TRACK]

FADE OUT.

### Scene 7 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Samantha is still fumbling with the lock picking tools as Jimmy gives her pointers. Suddenly, the door swings open, and TERRY, clipboard in hand, re-enters.

TERRY
(smiling)
Forgot my pen. I knew I left it somewhere.

[LAUGH TRACK]

He spots Samantha with the lock picking tools.

TERRY
(raised eyebrow)
What do we have here?

JIMMY
(proud)
Samantha’s learning the ropes. Gonna be a pro in no time.

Samantha grins, but her smile fades when she accidentally drops the lock picking tools.

SAMANTHA
(flustered)
Oops.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Terry chuckles, picking up his pen from the counter.

TERRY
(teasing)
Well, I can see she's got your grace, Jimmy.

Jimmy rolls his eyes, grinning.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Very funny, Terry.

Terry laughs, then grows serious.

TERRY
(serious)
You know, Jimmy, you should consider getting an apprentice. 

Jimmy looks surprised.

JIMMY
(surprised)
An apprentice?

TERRY
(nods)
Yeah. Someone who can learn from you, take over when you're not around. It's good for business.

Samantha looks thoughtful.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

Jimmy looks at Samantha, then back at Terry.

JIMMY
(amused)
Well, I already have one apprentice.

He gestures towards Samantha.

SAMANTHA
(flattered)
Aw, thanks, dad.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Terry chuckles, heading for the door.

TERRY
(waving)
Just something to think about, Jimmy. 

Jimmy watches Terry leave, then turns to Samantha.

JIMMY
(thoughtful)
An apprentice, huh?

Samantha picks up the dropped lock picking tools, grinning.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
Well, I think it's a great idea.

[LAUGH TRACK]

FADE OUT.

### Scene 8 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Samantha is still fiddling with the lock picking tools while Jimmy is pacing around, thinking about Terry's suggestion. 

SAMANTHA
(excited)
Think about it, dad. If we hire an apprentice, we could expand our services, maybe even open a second location.

JIMMY
(doubtful)
That's a big step, Samantha. And it's not just about business, it's about craftsmanship, about solving puzzles.

SAMANTHA
(defensive)
I know that, dad. I'm not saying we turn into some key-cutting factory. But an apprentice could help us grow.

JIMMY
(skeptical)
Or they could just slow us down.

SAMANTHA
(insistent)
Or they could speed us up!

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy stops pacing, looking at Samantha with a thoughtful expression.

JIMMY
(thoughtful)
Maybe you're right. But choosing the right person is crucial.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
I agree. We need someone passionate, someone who sees the art in locksmithing.

JIMMY
(amused)
Just like us.

SAMANTHA
(encouraged)
Exactly! We can find that person, dad.

Jimmy looks at Samantha, then at the lock picking tools in her hands, and smiles.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Well, if they can manage not to drop the tools as much as you do, they might be a good fit.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha rolls her eyes, grinning.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Very funny, dad.

Jimmy chuckles, looking at the lock picking tools in Samantha's hands.

JIMMY
(proud)
You're getting better at this, kiddo.

Samantha looks at the tools, then at Jimmy, a determined look on her face.

SAMANTHA
(determined)
I'll be the best, dad. You'll see.

Jimmy grins, patting Samantha on the shoulder.

JIMMY
(sincere)
I don't doubt it, Samantha.

They share a warm smile.

SAMANTHA
(excited)
So, are we doing this? Are we hiring an apprentice?

Jimmy looks at Samantha, then around the locksmith shop, and finally nods.

JIMMY
(decisive)
Alright. Let's do it.

Samantha jumps up, excited.

SAMANTHA
(excited)
Yes! This is going to be awesome!

Jimmy chuckles, shaking his head.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Just remember, they're not here to pick up your dropped tools.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha sticks her tongue out at Jimmy, and they both laugh.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 9 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Samantha is at the counter, Jimmy is in the back. A SECOND CUSTOMER walks in. Samantha straightens up, eager to help.

SECOND CUSTOMER
(slightly annoyed)
My kid swallowed the car keys. Again.

[LAUGH TRACK]

SAMANTHA
(surprised)
Again?

SECOND CUSTOMER
(rolls eyes)
You'd be surprised.

Samantha, trying to recall her modern business practices, pulls out a tablet.

SAMANTHA
(confident)
No problem. Let's get you a new key.

SECOND CUSTOMER
(skeptical)
On that thing?

SAMANTHA
(grinning)
Welcome to the future of locksmithing.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha starts tapping on the tablet. Suddenly, it starts making loud, unexpected noises.

SAMANTHA
(confused)
Uh...

SECOND CUSTOMER
(irritated)
Is it supposed to do that?

SAMANTHA
(defensive)
It's just... warming up.

[LAUGH TRACK]

The tablet continues to make noises. Jimmy comes out from the back, hearing the commotion.

JIMMY
(concerned)
What's going on?

SAMANTHA
(embarassed)
Just making a new key.

Jimmy looks at the tablet, then at the SECOND CUSTOMER, then back at Samantha.

JIMMY
(skeptical)
With that thing?

SAMANTHA
(defensive)
It's modern locksmithing, dad.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Suddenly, the tablet stops making noise. Samantha sighs in relief. But then, it spits out a key... for a completely different car.

SAMANTHA
(surprised)
Oh.

SECOND CUSTOMER
(annoyed)
That's not my key.

SAMANTHA
(defeated)
I can see that.

Jimmy chuckles, shaking his head.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Modern locksmithing, huh?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha hands the SECOND CUSTOMER the wrong key, embarrassed.

SAMANTHA
(apologetic)
Here, you can keep this as a... souvenir.

SECOND CUSTOMER
(sarcastic)
Great. Just what I always wanted.

Jimmy, trying to suppress his laughter, goes to cut a new key manually. Samantha looks at the tablet, then at the SECOND CUSTOMER, then at Jimmy.

SAMANTHA
(defensive)
I'm still learning.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 10 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Samantha is sitting at the counter, staring at the tablet. Jimmy walks over, holding the correct key for the SECOND CUSTOMER.

JIMMY
(smiling)
Here's your key. And no extra charge for the... souvenir.

SECOND CUSTOMER
(grateful)
Thank you.

[LAUGH TRACK]

The SECOND CUSTOMER leaves. Samantha still looks defeated. Jimmy sits next to her.

JIMMY
(concerned)
Hey, what's wrong kiddo?

SAMANTHA
(disappointed)
I messed up, dad. I thought I could handle the tablet, but I just embarrassed myself.

Jimmy puts an arm around Samantha.

JIMMY
(sincere)
Samantha, we all make mistakes. It's how we learn.

SAMANTHA
(looking at Jimmy)
But you never make mistakes.

JIMMY
(laughs)
Oh, I've made plenty. Remember the time I locked myself out of the shop?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha giggles, then looks thoughtful.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
Yeah, I remember. But you always bounce back. You never let anything get you down.

Jimmy grins, patting Samantha on the shoulder.

JIMMY
(encouraging)
And so will you. You're my daughter, after all.

Samantha grins, looking at the tablet again.

SAMANTHA
(determined)
You're right, dad. I'll figure this tablet out. I'll be the best modern locksmith ever!

Jimmy chuckles, shaking his head.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Just remember, it's not about being the best. It's about providing the best service to our customers.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha rolls her eyes, grinning.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Very funny, dad.

Jimmy smiles, patting Samantha on the back.

JIMMY
(proud)
I'm proud of you, Samantha. You're going to make a great locksmith.

Samantha grins, feeling encouraged. 

SAMANTHA
(excited)
Thanks, dad. I won't let you down.

Jimmy smiles, giving Samantha a thumbs up.

JIMMY
(confident)
I know you won't, kiddo.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 11 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Just as Samantha and Jimmy are feeling good about their decision to hire an apprentice, TERRY, the parole officer, walks in.

TERRY
(serious)
Surprise inspection.

[LAUGH TRACK]

SAMANTHA
(surprised)
Terry? What are you doing here?

TERRY
(smirking)
I heard you're hiring an apprentice. I need to make sure they won't be a bad influence.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Well, we're not hiring you, Terry.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Terry grins, walking around the shop, inspecting the tools.

TERRY
(poking fun)
Just making sure you're not planning on teaching them how to pick locks.

SAMANTHA
(defensive)
That's not what we do, Terry. We help people.

TERRY
(skeptical)
Yeah, by breaking into their homes and cars?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy rolls his eyes, chuckling.

JIMMY
(sarcastic)
Oh yeah, Terry. We're running a criminal empire here.

Samantha grins, watching Terry inspect the shop.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Next thing you know, he'll accuse us of planning a bank heist.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Terry stops inspecting, looking at Samantha and Jimmy, then bursts out laughing.

TERRY
(laughs)
I'd pay good money to see that.

Jimmy grins, shaking his head.

JIMMY
(sincere)
Well, Terry, you're always welcome to stop by. But we're just humble locksmiths.

Terry nods, looking around the shop one last time.

TERRY
(satisfied)
Alright, everything seems in order here. Just remember, no funny business.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
But Terry, we're a sitcom. Funny business is our specialty.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Terry chuckles, heading towards the door.

TERRY
(smiling)
I'll be keeping an eye on you two.

Jimmy and Samantha wave as Terry leaves, then look at each other, grinning.

JIMMY
(teasing)
So, are you ready to start training our future apprentice, master locksmith?

SAMANTHA
(excited)
Absolutely, dad. This is going to be great.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 12 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Jimmy and Samantha are sitting at a table with a pile of resumes for the apprentice position. Samantha is holding the tablet, looking determined.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Ready to conquer modern technology?

SAMANTHA
(determined)
Absolutely. Bring on the digital age.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy chuckles, picking up the first resume.

JIMMY
(reading)
This one's a former magician. Says he's good with locks.

SAMANTHA
(confused)
Magician?

JIMMY
(shrugs)
Maybe he can make our problems disappear.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha rolls her eyes, tapping on the tablet.

SAMANTHA
(serious)
We need someone serious, dad.

JIMMY
(teasing)
You mean, someone like Terry?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha glares at Jimmy.

SAMANTHA
(sarcastic)
Very funny, dad.

Jimmy chuckles, putting the magician's resume aside.

JIMMY
(smiling)
Alright, let's see... next one is a former locksmith. But, he lost his job because he was... too slow.

SAMANTHA
(laughs)
Too slow? How is that even possible?

JIMMY
(shrugs)
Maybe he was too busy admiring his work.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Samantha chuckles, shaking her head. She taps on the tablet, pulling up a resume.

SAMANTHA
(excited)
Here's one! A recent graduate from a technical school. Specialized in locksmithing and security systems.

Jimmy looks impressed.

JIMMY
(sincere)
Now, that sounds promising.

Samantha grins, looking at the tablet.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
I think we found our apprentice.

Jimmy nods, looking satisfied.

JIMMY
(proud)
You did good, kiddo. I think we're ready for this.

Samantha grins, feeling accomplished. 

SAMANTHA
(excited)
Thanks, dad. Let's do this.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 13 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Jimmy and Samantha are at the counter. A THIRD CUSTOMER, a frazzled woman holding a small child, enters the shop.

THIRD CUSTOMER
(desperate)
Please tell me you can help me. I've locked my keys in the car. 

SAMANTHA
(assuring)
Of course, we can help. We'll get you back in your car in no time.

Jimmy grins, patting Samantha on the back.

JIMMY
(proud)
That's my girl.

[LAUGH TRACK]

THIRD CUSTOMER
(grateful)
Thank you. I really appreciate it. 

Jimmy and Samantha gather their tools and head out. The scene transitions to the parking lot where the woman's car is. Samantha works on the lock while Jimmy distracts the child with a jingling set of keys.

JIMMY
(to the child)
You see, this is why you should never play with mommy's keys.

[LAUGH TRACK]

The child giggles, reaching for the keys. Samantha pops the car door open.

SAMANTHA
(triumphant)
Got it!

The woman hugs Samantha, relieved.

THIRD CUSTOMER
(teary-eyed)
Thank you so much! 

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
No problem at all. We're here to help.

Jimmy hands the child back to the woman, who gratefully takes her child.

THIRD CUSTOMER
(relieved)
I can't thank you enough.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Just remember us next time you lock yourself out.

[LAUGH TRACK]

They all laugh as the woman gets in her car and drives off. Samantha and Jimmy return to the shop.

JIMMY
(proud)
You did great, Samantha.

SAMANTHA
(confident)
Thanks, dad. I think I'm getting the hang of this.

Jimmy smiles, patting Samantha on the back.

JIMMY
(sincere)
I knew you would, kiddo.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 14 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Samantha and Jimmy are cleaning up the shop when TERRY walks back in, looking thoughtful.

SAMANTHA
(surprised)
Terry? Back so soon? 

TERRY
(sincere)
Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something.

JIMMY
(teasing)
Oh? Finally ready to admit you've lost your keys?

[LAUGH TRACK]

Terry chuckles, shaking his head.

TERRY
(serious)
No, it's about your apprentice program.

Samantha and Jimmy exchange curious looks.

SAMANTHA
(serious)
What about it?

TERRY
(sincere)
I've got a guy. He's recently out on parole, looking for a second chance. He's good with his hands, quick learner.

Samantha and Jimmy look at each other, intrigued.

JIMMY
(considering)
Well, we're all about second chances here.

SAMANTHA
(curious)
What's his story?

TERRY
(softly)
Made some bad choices when he was young. But he's trying to turn his life around.

Samantha and Jimmy exchange a glance.

SAMANTHA
(decided)
We'll interview him. 

TERRY
(relieved)
That's all I'm asking. 

Jimmy nods, patting Terry on the shoulder.

JIMMY
(grateful)
Thanks for thinking of us, Terry.

TERRY
(smiling)
I've seen you two in action. If anyone can give this guy a chance, it's you.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Just promise us you won't surprise inspect us every week.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Terry chuckles, heading towards the door.

TERRY
(smiling)
No promises.

Jimmy and Samantha wave as Terry leaves. Samantha turns to Jimmy, looking serious.

SAMANTHA
(sincere)
I think we're doing the right thing, dad.

JIMMY
(proud)
I know we are, kiddo.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 15 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Jimmy and Samantha are at the counter, cleaning up after the previous customer. Suddenly, the door swings open and a nervous looking YOUNG MAN walks in.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Dad, I think we have a customer.

JIMMY
(smiling)
I think you're right, kiddo. 

They approach the young man.

JIMMY
(friendly)
Morning! What can we do for you?

YOUNG MAN
(nervously)
I'm...I'm here for the apprentice position?

Jimmy and Samantha exchange surprised glances.

SAMANTHA
(surprised)
You're Terry's guy?

YOUNG MAN
(relieved)
Yes, that's me.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
Well, let's get started then. 

[LAUGH TRACK]

They lead him to a lock-picking set-up. Jimmy steps back, allowing Samantha to take the lead. 

SAMANTHA
(confident)
Alright, let's see what you can do.

The young man begins to work on the lock. Samantha watches him, looking impressed. After a few moments, the lock pops open.

SAMANTHA
(excited)
You did it!

[LAUGH TRACK]

YOUNG MAN
(relieved)
Really?

Jimmy claps him on the back.

JIMMY
(proud)
Welcome aboard, kid. 

[LAUGH TRACK]

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
Great job. We're glad to have you.

YOUNG MAN
(grateful)
Thank you. I won't let you down.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
You better not. We've got a lot of locks to pick.

[LAUGH TRACK]

They all laugh as the young man starts to clean up the lock-picking set-up.

JIMMY
(teasing)
That's my girl. Always keeping them on their toes.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
You taught me well, dad.

Jimmy pats Samantha on the back, looking proud.

JIMMY
(sincere)
I sure did, kiddo.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 16 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - MORNING

Jimmy, Samantha, and the YOUNG MAN, now revealed as EDDIE, are in the shop. The door chimes as a rush of CUSTOMERS flood in.

JIMMY
(surprised)
Whoa, looks like we've hit a boom!

SAMANTHA
(nervously)
Or a locksmith apocalypse.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Eddie looks overwhelmed. 

EDDIE
(nervously)
I didn't sign up for a locksmith apocalypse...

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Too late to back out now, Eddie. 

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy claps Eddie on the back.

JIMMY
(encouraging)
You'll do fine, kid. Just remember what Samantha taught you.

Eddie nods, looking determined. Samantha, Jimmy, and Eddie split up to help the customers. The shop buzzes with activity.

A CUSTOMER approaches Eddie.

CUSTOMER
(desperate)
I locked my keys in my car. Can you help?

EDDIE
(confident)
Absolutely, we'll get you sorted.

The customer looks relieved. Samantha watches from the corner, smiling.

SAMANTHA
(to herself)
He's got this.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy approaches Samantha, watching Eddie with pride.

JIMMY
(proud)
He's a natural, just like you.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Well, he did have a great teacher.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy laughs, patting Samantha on the back.

JIMMY
(proud)
That's my girl.

They continue helping customers. Eddie successfully opens a lock for a customer.

EDDIE
(triumphant)
Got it!

CUSTOMER
(grateful)
Thank you so much!

Eddie beams, looking at Samantha and Jimmy for approval. They give him a thumbs up. 

SAMANTHA
(encouraging)
Keep it up, Eddie!

The shop continues to buzz with activity, laughter, and the sound of locks clicking open.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 17 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - AFTERNOON

The shop is quiet after the morning rush. Jimmy, Samantha, and Eddie are cleaning up. Samantha finds an old photo album while tidying up a shelf.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
Hey, look what I found!

She opens the album, revealing photos of a younger Jimmy at work.

JIMMY
(laughing)
Oh boy, where did you dig that up?

SAMANTHA
(grinning)
It was hiding behind some old locks.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Eddie comes over to look at the photos.

EDDIE
(amused)
Wow, is that you, Jimmy?

JIMMY
(slightly embarrassed)
In the flesh. And about 20 years younger.

[LAUGH TRACK]

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
And with a lot more hair.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy playfully swats at Samantha.

JIMMY
(defensive)
Hey, I still have plenty of hair!

Samantha flips to a page with a photo of her as a little girl, sitting on the counter of the shop, playing with a set of keys.

SAMANTHA
(nostalgic)
I remember this. I was so fascinated with all the different keys.

JIMMY
(smiling)
You've always had a knack for this business, kiddo. 

EDDIE
(curious)
So, you grew up in this shop, Samantha?

SAMANTHA
(sincere)
Yeah, I did. It was like my second home.

JIMMY
(proud)
More like your first.

[LAUGH TRACK]

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
True. I learned everything I know from this old man.

Jimmy gives her a proud look.

JIMMY
(sincere)
And I couldn't be prouder of what you've become, kiddo.

They share a warm moment. Eddie looks on, touched by their bond.

EDDIE
(smiling)
I hope I can make you guys just as proud.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Well, you survived the locksmith apocalypse. That's a good start.

[LAUGH TRACK]

They all laugh, sharing in the joy of their small locksmith family. Samantha closes the photo album, placing it back on the shelf.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 18 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON

The shop is calm, with Samantha, Jimmy, and Eddie wrapping up for the day. Suddenly, the bell above the door rings as TERRY, an older eccentric man, enters the shop.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Speak of the devil, it's Terry!

TERRY
(smiling)
I heard you had an apocalypse this morning. 

[LAUGH TRACK]

JIMMY
(laughing)
Just a rush, Terry. Nothing we couldn't handle.

Terry looks at Eddie, who's nervously trying to tidy up the counter.

TERRY
(teasing)
I see you've survived the first day, Eddie. 

EDDIE
(nervously)
Barely...

[LAUGH TRACK]

TERRY
(laughs)
Just remember, Eddie, the key to being a good locksmith...

Terry takes out a large, ornate key from his pocket.

TERRY
(seriously)
...is to always have the right key.

[LAUGH TRACK]

SAMANTHA
(snickering)
That's your wisdom, Terry? 

TERRY
(smiling)
It's not the key itself, it's knowing when to use it. 

Jimmy nods, appreciating Terry's eccentric wisdom. Eddie looks on, confused but intrigued.

JIMMY
(sincerely)
That's why you're the master, Terry.

TERRY
(laughs)
And don't you forget it.

Terry leaves the shop, leaving them with his parting words.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Well, Eddie, you ready for day two?

EDDIE
(smiling)
As ready as I'll ever be.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Jimmy claps Eddie on the back.

JIMMY
(encouraging)
You're doing great, kid.

They all share a laugh as they finish tidying up the shop, ready for another day.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 19 ###
INT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - EVENING

Jimmy, Samantha, and Eddie are closing up the shop. The light outside is fading, casting long shadows inside.

JIMMY
(tired, but satisfied)
Well, we survived the day.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
And the locksmith apocalypse.

[LAUGH TRACK]

Eddie locks the front door, a triumphant smile on his face.

EDDIE
(confident)
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

Jimmy gives him a proud nod, while Samantha starts counting the cash register.

SAMANTHA
(amused)
Just wait until you meet the Christmas rush, Eddie.

EDDIE
(nervously)
Christmas rush?

[LAUGH TRACK]

JIMMY
(laughs)
Don't scare the kid, Samantha.

Samantha grins, finishing up with the cash register.

SAMANTHA
(smiling)
Just a joke, Eddie. You did great today.

Eddie looks relieved.

EDDIE
(grateful)
Thanks, Samantha. It means a lot.

Jimmy claps Eddie on the shoulder.

JIMMY
(encouraging)
You're part of the family now, kid. Keep up the good work.

Eddie beams at the praise, looking more confident.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Just remember, Eddie, don't lose your keys.

[LAUGH TRACK]

EDDIE
(laughs)
I'll try to remember that.

They share a laugh, the shop filled with a sense of accomplishment and hope. Jimmy turns off the lights, leaving only the soft glow from the streetlights outside. Samantha hangs a CLOSED sign on the door.

JIMMY
(satisfied)
See you all tomorrow.

SAMANTHA and EDDIE
(in unison)
See you tomorrow, Jimmy.

FADE OUT.

### Scene 20 ###
EXT. JIMMY'S LOCKSMITH SHOP - NIGHT

The shop is peaceful and quiet under the soft glow of the streetlights. The CLOSED sign glows through the window. 

Suddenly, a CAT wanders into the frame, batting at a piece of paper on the ground.

[LAUGH TRACK]

The cat suddenly gets spooked and bolts, knocking over a small trash can. 

[LAUGH TRACK]

From inside the shop, we see the silhouette of JIMMY, laughing and shaking his head.

JIMMY
(amused)
That darn cat, always up to no good.

Suddenly, SAMANTHA and EDDIE appear behind Jimmy, looking out the window.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Maybe we should get a shop cat. It would certainly keep things interesting.

[LAUGH TRACK]

EDDIE
(nervously)
As long as it doesn't have a key to the shop...

[LAUGH TRACK]

They all laugh, sharing in the quiet camaraderie of the night.

SAMANTHA
(teasing)
Goodnight, Eddie. Don't let the bed bugs bite.

EDDIE
(laughs)
I'll try not to.

They all wave goodbye and slowly disperse, leaving the locksmith shop bathed in the soft glow of the streetlights.

FADE OUT.
